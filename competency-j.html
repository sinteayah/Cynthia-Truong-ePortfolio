												style="width: 100%; max-width: 480px; float: left; margin-right: 1em; box-shadow: 2px 2px 4px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.5); border-radius: 10px;">
											</a>

													In the library world, we often say we “connect people with the information they need.” But to do this meaningfully, 
													we must first understand how people seek that information—and why they might not. Whether someone is navigating a 
													health crisis, preparing for a job interview, or simply exploring a personal interest, their information-seeking 
													behavior is influenced by far more than curiosity. Factors like emotional state, prior experience, digital fluency, 
													cultural background, social context, convenience, and trust in institutions all shape how people recognize a need, 
													search for, evaluate, and use information. </p>
												<p style="line-height: 1.5; margin-bottom: 1em;">
													As a future public librarian, I see it as part of my role to anticipate and respond to these behaviors 
													with empathy, equity, and intentional design. Through coursework, readings, and hands-on experience, 
													I’ve come to appreciate that understanding information-seeking behavior isn’t just theoretical—it’s 
													essential to delivering equitable and effective service. Models such as Kuhlthau’s <i>Information Search Process</i>, 
													Savolainen’s <i>Everyday Life Information Seeking (ELIS)</i>, and Chatman’s <i>Theory of Information Poverty</i> 
													have helped me better recognize both the visible and invisible barriers patrons may face. By aligning 
													library services with the way people actually seek and use information, we can strive to create 
													stronger connections, more inclusive environments, and better outcomes for all.</p>
												
												<h3 style="margin-bottom: 0.5em;">Information-seeking Behavior Models & Theories</h3>
												<h5 style="margin-bottom: 0.3em;">Elfreda Chatman</h5>
												<p style="line-height: 1.5; margin-bottom: 0.5em;">
													One of the first theories I encountered in my studies was Elfreda Chatman’s <i>Theory of Information Poverty</i>. 
													This theory has had a profound impact on how I approach all other information-seeking models and 
													frameworks. Chatman’s work focuses on the ways in which marginalized groups, especially those living in 
													poverty or social isolation, experience significant barriers to accessing and using information 
													(Chatman, 1996). She introduced the concept of “information poverty,” where individuals may not only 
													lack the resources or tools to find information but may also be unaware of their own information 
													needs, or feel discouraged from seeking information due to social or institutional barriers (Chatman, 1996). 
													Her research emphasized the complex social, emotional, and contextual factors that contribute to 
													these challenges, laying the groundwork for a deeper understanding of how the information-seeking 
													process can be shaped by external circumstances.</p>
												<p style="line-height: 1.5; margin-bottom: 1em;">
													Chatman also developed <i>Life in a Round</i>, a theory that builds upon her previous work. 
													In this theory, Chatman (1999) explored the lived experiences of individuals who exist within social, 
													economic, and information isolation, and how their daily routines, attitudes, and behaviors shape 
													their information needs. The central idea of <i>Life in a Round</i> is that individuals within 
													these constrained environments don’t necessarily seek new information outside their immediate 
													social circles; instead, they gather and exchange information within their close-knit communities 
													(Chatman, 1999). These individuals may not be aware of or interested in seeking information outside 
													of their immediate sphere, which is why their information needs and behaviors may go unrecognized 
													by traditional information systems (Chatman, 1999).</p>
												<h5 style="margin-bottom: 0.3em;">Carol Kuhlthau</h5>
												<p style="line-height: 1.5; margin-bottom: 1em;">
													Another influential model in the field is Carol Kuhlthau’s <i>Information Search Process</i> (1991), 
													which details the stages individuals go through while seeking information: initiation, selection, 
													exploration, formulation, collection, and presentation. This model highlights the emotional 
													journey that accompanies information-seeking, emphasizing feelings of uncertainty and confusion at 
													the beginning of the process, which gradually give way to clarity and satisfaction as the user 
													narrows their focus and gains confidence (Kuhlthau, 1991). Kuhlthau’s model encourages librarians 
													to consider how users' emotions—such as anxiety or frustration—can influence their information-seeking 
													behavior and how library services can help ease these emotional barriers.</p>
												<h5 style="margin-bottom: 0.3em;">Reijo Savolainen</h5>
												<p style="line-height: 1.5; margin-bottom: 1em;">
													Reijo Savolainen’s <i>Everyday Life Information Seeking</i> (ELIS) model (1995) adds another 
													layer to understanding information behavior by focusing on the context in which individuals 
													seek information in their daily lives. Rather than approaching information-seeking as a 
													detached, cognitive task, Savolainen emphasizes that information-seeking is deeply embedded 
													in the routines, habits, and social contexts of individuals’ lives (Savolainen, 1995). By recognizing this, 
													librarians can better understand why people seek information in the first place and how 
													their existing routines and social networks impact their search strategies.</p>
												<h5 style="margin-bottom: 0.3em;">Marcia Bates</h5>
												<p style="line-height: 1.5; margin-bottom: 1em;">
													Finally, Marcia Bates’ “berry-picking” model of information seeking (1989) offers a dynamic, 
													non-linear approach to understanding how people gather information. Rather than following a 
													clear, straight path from information need to solution, I see the berry-picking model as 
													depicting a more organic process where users gather bits and pieces of information from various 
													sources over time, often revisiting and refining their search strategies. This model challenges 
													the traditional view of information-seeking as a one-time, goal-oriented task and illustrates 
													the importance of flexibility and adaptability in the search process.</p>
												<h5 style="margin-bottom: 0.3em;">The Role of Libraries</h5>
												<p style="line-height: 1.5; margin-bottom: .5em;">
													In light of these theories and models, the role of libraries becomes even more important. 
													Libraries are uniquely positioned to meet the diverse and dynamic information needs of their communities. 
													By understanding how individuals from different backgrounds approach information-seeking, librarians 
													can design services that remove barriers and provide equitable access to information. 
													For example, libraries can offer personal services for individuals facing information poverty, 
													some examples like outreach programs for underserved communities or creating spaces for 
													informal information exchange. Additionally, library staff can support users at different 
													stages of the information-seeking process by providing emotional support, guidance, and 
													encouragement, particularly for those who may experience anxiety or frustration during the 
													search process (Kuhlthau, 1991).</p>
												<p style="line-height: 1.5; margin-bottom: 1em;">
													Moreover, the digital age has introduced new challenges and opportunities in information seeking. 
													As more users rely on online sources for information, it’s becoming more important for libraries 
													to widen their offers in digital literacy training and support to help users navigate the 
													complexities of the internet and evaluate the credibility of online resources. 
													By combining traditional library services with modern digital tools, libraries can 
													continue to be trusted sources of information for all members of the community.</p>

													For my final paper in the Information Communities (INFO 200) course, I conducted a comprehensive research project on the 
													information-seeking behaviors within the manga reader community. Throughout the semester, I explored how manga enthusiasts 
													engage with information via platforms like social media, fan forums, and dedicated manga websites. I focused on how 
													events such as new chapter releases or major developments in manga series prompt collective information-seeking behaviors, 
													highlighting some ways on how the community shares and discusses information. This research allowed me to apply 
													theories like Carol Kuhlthau’s Information Search Process and Marcia Bates’ berrypicking model, which deepened my 
													understanding of how users progress through various stages of seeking information. By analyzing these patterns, 
													I gained insight into how information professionals can connect users with accurate, relevant, and timely information. 
													This experience reinforced the importance of understanding the nuances of information-seeking behaviors in making 
													sure that services meet the dynamic needs of communities such as manga readers.</p>

												<p style="line-height: 1.5; margin-bottom: 0.5em;"> 
													In my Reference and Information Services (INFO 210) course, I participated in the Jails and Reentry Services (JARS) 
													program with the San Francisco Public Library (SFPL), offering reference services to incarcerated individuals across 
													California through the "Reference by Mail" system. I responded to multiple reference requests, conducting research 
													to provide accurate and accessible information to inmates with limited resources. One of the requests involved assisting 
													an inmate in finding nonprofit services for veterans, which required verifying information and considering sensitive 
													privacy issues. This experience highlighted the critical role that timely, accurate information plays in successful 
													reintegration, and it allowed me to apply core library principles such as intellectual freedom and equitable access. 
													The project also reinforced the relevance of Elfreda Chatman’s theory of "information poverty," particularly in the 
													context of incarcerated individuals. Many inmates face significant barriers to accessing information, either due 
													to resource limitations or because they lack awareness of their information needs. This experience underscored 
													the importance of tailoring library services to meet the unique needs of marginalized populations and making sure 
													that information remains accessible and relevant to their specific context. Understanding these information-seeking 
													behaviors is essential to promoting equitable access and supporting individuals in overcoming barriers.</p>
												
												<h4 style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Wm700TT28EUUgYwrDVGEdxTtpQ96en35/view?usp=sharing" target="_blank">LIS Model/Theory Research Summary: Life in the round (INFO 200)<i class="fas fa-link"></i></a></h4>
												<p style="line-height: 1.5; margin-bottom: 0.5em;"> 
													In my Information Communities (INFO 200) course, I completed an assignment titled "<i>LIS Model/Theory Research Summary: Life in the Round</i>," 
													which delved into Elfreda A. Chatman’s Theory of Life in the Round. This theory examines how marginalized groups, such as 
													prisoners or ethnic minorities, engage with information within their tightly-knit, self-contained communities. 
													Chatman suggests that individuals in these groups often show little interest in seeking information from outside 
													their social circles. She instead focuses on the norms and routines of their immediate environment. 
													In the assignment, I applied this theory to various communities, including my semester-long research on 
													manga readers, while reviewing studies that expanded on Chatman’s ideas. This research helped me 
													understand how social and contextual factors shape the information-seeking behaviors of marginalized groups. 
													I learned that individuals in these communities may not actively seek external information, making it 
													critical for library professionals to tailor their services to meet these needs. This insight is important 
													in making sure that information professionals provide relevant, accessible information to populations 
													that may not engage with traditional information systems.</p><br>
	
												<h3>Conclusion</h3>
												<p style="line-height: 1.5; margin-bottom: 0.5em;"> 
													In conclusion, studying information-seeking behaviors has shown me how important it is for public libraries 
													to understand the unique needs of our communities. Being guided by these various theories like Kuhlthau’s 
													focus on emotions and Savolainen’s emphasis on everyday life, I can better support patrons beyond just 
													providing information. Libraries are spaces for guidance and reassurance, especially for those facing 
													barriers like digital illiteracy. As a future librarian, I would like to create environments where 
													patrons feel confident and empowered, making sure that they find the information they need in a way 
													that’s accessible and meaningful.</p>
