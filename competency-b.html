									<h2>Competency B</h2>
									<p style="font-family: 'Open Sans', Arial, sans-serif; font-weight: 300;">Describe and compare different organizational settings in which information professionals practice. </p>
								</header>



								<section>
									<h3 style="margin-bottom: 0.5em;">Introduction</h3>
									<p style="line-height: 1.5; margin-bottom: .5em;">
										As I’ve studied the field of librarianship, one thing has stood out above all: information professionals play a 
										critical role in helping society make sense of an overwhelming and often chaotic information landscape. 
										Whether they are guiding a student through their first research project, helping a job seeker navigate online forms, 
										or supporting physicians in managing complex data, information professionals act as connectors between people 
										and the knowledge they need to move forward. Their work often happens quietly, behind the scenes—butI can see 
										how the impact can be far-reaching. These professionals don’t just manage books and databases; they promote access, 
										reduce barriers, and help individuals make informed decisions in their personal, academic, and professional lives.</p>
									<p style="line-height: 1.5; margin-bottom: 1em;">
										But their work also varies significantly depending on the organizational setting. A school librarian’s day 
										looks very different from that of a medical librarian or a public librarian in a rural town. Each environment 
										shapes how information services are delivered and how professionals interact with their users. For this competency, 
										I will compare public, school, academic, and special libraries using the criteria of mission, users, funding, 
										governance, and professional responsibilities. By doing so, I aim to better understand how these different 
										settings influence the work of information professionals—and what that might mean for my own path in the field.</p>
							
										
										<h5 style="margin-bottom: 0.3em;">Public Libraries</h5>
									<p style="line-height: 1.5; margin-bottom: 0.5em;">
										Public libraries are community-centered institutions designed to serve all members of the public, including 
										children, working adults, seniors, and vulnerable populations such as those experiencing homelessness or 
										mental illness. Their mission often reflects democratic values—open access, equity, and civic engagement 
										(Freudenberger, 2022; Smith, 2018). In fact, as early as the 1960s and 70s, librarians like Kathleen Weibel (1983) 
										were already working to break down barriers, launching outreach programs to reach individuals historically 
										excluded from traditional library services.</p>
									<p style="line-height: 1.5; margin-bottom: 0.5em;">
										These institutions are primarily funded by local city or county property taxes, creating a wide disparity 
										in resources depending on geographic location (Freudenberger, 2022). A library in an affluent suburb might 
										offer cutting-edge technology, robust programming, and extensive staffing—while one in an underfunded area 
										must stretch every dollar, often depending on community partnerships and innovative strategies to serve growing needs.</p>
									<p style="line-height: 1.5; margin-bottom: 1em;">
										As public libraries begin to change, today’s public librarians now wear many hats. Beyond managing books, 
										they assist with job searches, provide digital literacy training, run programs for all ages, and even help 
										connect people to health and housing services. Increasingly, they are the first line of support for patrons 
										facing complex social challenges. Smith (2018) highlights this evolving role, portraying libraries as modern-day 
										civic hubs—places where people not only access information, but also build connections, find support, and 
										engage with the broader world, even as resources remain tight.</p>													
										
										<h5 style="margin-bottom: 0.3em;">Academic Libraries </h5>
										<div style="float: left; margin: 1em 1em 1em 0;">
											<img src="library-la-trobe-study-students.jpeg" alt="Students studying at La Trobe University Library" 
											style="width: 100%; max-width: 550px; box-shadow: 2px 2px 4px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.5); border-radius: 10px;">
										</div>

										<p style="line-height: 1.5; margin-bottom: 0.5em;">
										Academic libraries are essential pillars of higher education, embedded within institutions like community 
										colleges, universities, and research centers. Their core mission revolves around supporting students, 
										faculty, and researchers through access to knowledge, scholarly communication, and educational success 
										(Mavrinac, 2022). Whether it's guiding undergraduates through their first research paper or aiding faculty 
										in publishing cutting-edge studies, academic libraries are deeply aligned with both learning and the 
										institution’s broader research goals.</p>
									<p style="line-height: 1.5; margin-bottom: 0.5em;">
										Funding for these libraries typically comes from a mix of student tuition, government allocations, 
										and institutional budgets. Yet, despite these multiple revenue streams, many academic libraries operate 
										under mounting financial pressure. One of the most persistent challenges is the escalating cost of 
										scholarly journal subscriptions and bundled electronic resource packages (Mavrinac, 2022). These budget 
										strains often force librarians to make difficult choices about what materials can be directly offered 
										and which must be accessed through interlibrary loans or consortia.</p>
									<p style="line-height: 1.5; margin-bottom: 1em;">
										Academic librarians are highly skilled professionals—many hold advanced degrees in specialized 
										disciplines in addition to their MLIS. Their responsibilities often go well beyond managing collections. 
										They create tailored research guides, teach students how to navigate complex databases, 
										support faculty with data management and publishing, grant writing, and even contribute original 
										scholarship themselves. As White-Farnham and Caffrey (2023) note, outreach has become an 
										increasingly strategic focus, with librarians actively cultivating partnerships across 
										departments to connect with stronger, more engaged academic communities.</p>

										<h5 style="margin-bottom: 0.3em;">School Libraries</h5>
									<p style="line-height: 1.5; margin-bottom: 0.5em;">
										School libraries, also known as media centers, are focused on supporting student learning in primary 
										and secondary education (Harlan, 2022). Their mission includes building reading habits, guiding students 
										through research projects, and helping them become more thoughtful users of information (Harlan, 2022). 
										School librarians often collaborate with teachers to reinforce classroom instruction while also 
										encouraging students to explore topics of personal interest.</p>
									<p style="line-height: 1.5; margin-bottom: 0.5em;">
										Typically funded and overseen by public school systems, school libraries are deeply tied to broader 
										educational policies and budgets in the community. As Harlan (2022) points out, this connection 
										can result in stark disparities—particularly in underfunded districts where library services may 
										be limited or entirely absent. Yet when properly supported, school libraries become powerful 
										tools for equity, giving all students the chance to access resources, develop academic skills, 
										and find joy in learning.</p>
									<p style="line-height: 1.5; margin-bottom: 1em;">
										A central focus of school librarianship is preparing students for the complex world of information 
										they navigate daily. Through lessons on digital literacy, students learn how to identify credible 
										sources, recognize bias, and evaluate the reliability of what they read—especially online. Harlan 
										(2022) emphasizes that these skills are crucial for fostering informed, engaged citizens in a media-saturated society.</p>		

										<h5 style="margin-bottom: 0.3em;">Special Libraries</h5>
									<p style="line-height: 1.5; margin-bottom: 0.5em;">
										Special libraries operate within specialized environments such as hospitals, law firms, corporations, 
										museums, and government agencies—places where timely, precise information can directly impact outcomes. 
										Unlike public or academic libraries, these institutions serve a defined user group, delivering expert-level 
										resources tailored to professional, often mission-critical needs. Funded and managed internally by their 
										parent organizations, special libraries are governed by departmental or executive leadership, and their 
										value is measured not in circulation numbers, but in how effectively they enhance organizational goals. 
										Whether it's streamlining clinical decisions, improving legal research, or supporting innovation 
										through access to proprietary data, special libraries are deeply embedded in the day-to-day functioning 
										of their institutions (Nault, 2010).</p>
									<p style="line-height: 1.5; margin-bottom: 1em;">
										The work of special librarians can vary depending on their focus but it is often both highly technical 
										and deeply collaborative. They possess subject expertise alongside strong skills in information management, 
										data analysis, and research. For example, a health sciences librarian might assist in evaluating 
										evidence for a treatment plan, while a law librarian makes sure things are up-to-date access to 
										statutes and case law. As Nault (2010) points out, these professionals face unique challenges: 
										navigating fast-paced environments, keeping up with rapid changes in technology, and continuously 
										demonstrating their value within results-driven organizations. Yet their adaptability and specialized 
										knowledge make them indispensable in fields where the right information—delivered at the right 
										time—can make all the difference.</p>
							
									<h2>Evidence</h2>
									<h4 style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Jl87PwdRUF6oZtest_yungE2A4fbPHy7/view?usp=sharing" target="_blank">University Library Building Use Trends (INFO 285)<i class="fas fa-link"></i></a></h4>
									<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1">
										<p style="line-height: 1.5; margin-bottom: 1em;">
											My first piece of evidence is a logic model project I completed for INFO 285, where I evaluated building use trends in an academic library setting. 
											The goal was to assess how students and faculty used different library spaces and resources and to suggest ways to improve services and space planning. 
											I contributed to analyzing outputs such as study room use and computing demand, while also addressing broader outcomes related to user experience 
											and institutional priorities like enrollment growth and funding. This artifact demonstrates my understanding of how academic libraries function 
											as research and learning hubs within higher education institutions. Unlike public libraries that serve broad community needs or special libraries 
											that support niche professionals, academic libraries focus on student success and faculty scholarship. This project deepened my awareness of 
											how data-informed decision-making supports these unique goals. My use of a structured evaluation tool—logic modeling—also shows how information 
											professionals can contribute strategically within higher education by aligning library services with evolving academic priorities.</p>

									<p style="line-height: 1.5; margin-bottom: 1em;"> 
										The second artifact is a report I created for an <i>Information Retrieval System Design</i> (INFO 202) discussion assignment, 
										where I synthesized five scholarly sources exploring the relationship between data science and libraries. I highlighted topics 
										such as the DIKW hierarchy, bibliomining, and how data science competencies differ across sectors. My report emphasized the 
										contrast between data librarians in academic institutions—who often work in support of faculty research—and those in government 
										or corporate environments, where analytics serve regulatory or business functions. This report shows my ability to compare 
										the roles of information professionals in different data-rich settings. I critically evaluated how core library values like 
										user access, ethical stewardship, and knowledge sharing can be applied even in highly technical environments. In doing so, 
										I gained insight into how information professionals need to be flexible in applying their expertise across organizations with 
										varying missions and cultures. This artifact illustrates that I can think beyond the traditional library and understand how 
										ibrarianship intersects with evolving fields like data science.</p>
									
									<h4 style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1vv7l9TixrhqTRCRljl0zDnZ2ZwhVu_yr/view?usp=sharing" target="_blank">Digital Curation Case Study: Donor/Client Interview (INFO 284)<i class="fas fa-link"></i></a></h4>
									<p style="line-height: 1.5; margin-bottom: 0.5em;"> 
										In this project for Digital Curation (INFO 284), I played the role as the Librarian/Archivist for the fictional Aquatic 
										Conservation Center (ACC), a nonprofit focused on aquatic education and environmental stewardship. I curated a digital 
										collection of freshwater aquatic plants designed for aquascaping hobbyists, collaborating with a donor to develop 
										educational content and preserve visual examples using the digital preservation platform Preservica. This experience 
										reflected the responsibilities of information professionals working in special libraries or cultural heritage 
										institutions, where community engagement, subject-specific content, and donor collaboration are key components of practice.
									</p><p style="line-height: 1.5; margin-bottom: 1em;">
										Compared to academic or public libraries, where services are driven by curriculum or broad community needs, 
										the ACC supported a niche audience with a strong educational and conservation mission. This setting demanded 
										different strategies—such as hands-on learning tools and informal outreach—to make specialized information approachable. 
										The project highlighted how information professionals in special library environments must adapt digital curation, 
										access, and preservation practices to serve targeted user communities, demonstrating the varied ways librarians and 
										archivists operate across organizational settings.</p>

									<p style="line-height: 1.5; margin-bottom: 0.5em;"> 
										In my Information Professions (INFO 240) course, my team and I created a five-year strategic plan (2023–2028) 
										for <i>Ardenwood Historic Farm</i>, a public historical site in Fremont, California. This project involved multiple 
										site visits, interviews with staff, and an in-depth analysis of the organization’s needs. We developed a mission 
										statement, conducted a SWOT analysis, and drafted strategic goals. I led the development of Strategic Goals 1 and 3, 
										which focused on strengthening internal operations and expanding community engagement through inclusive educational 
										programming. I also designed the presentation slides and integrated social media components to support Ardenwood’s digital outreach efforts.
									</p><p style="line-height: 1.5; margin-bottom: 1em;">
										Working with a cultural heritage organization allowed me to apply information professional skills in a setting 
										very different from traditional libraries. Unlike academic or public libraries, Ardenwood operates with a focus 
										on historical interpretation and community education through physical experiences and programming. This project 
										required understanding how mission, governance, clientele, and outreach vary across organizational types. By 
										tailoring strategic goals to fit Ardenwood’s unique identity and audience, I gained valuable insight into how 
										information work must adapt across different environments. It also deepened my appreciation for the diverse 
										roles information professionals can play in planning, community engagement, and inclusive storytelling within non-library contexts.</p>
	
									<h3>Conclusion</h3>
									<p style="line-height: 1.5; margin-bottom: 0.5em;"> 
										Exploring the different settings where information professionals work has made one thing clear: there 
										is no single path in this field. Each type of library—public, school, academic, or special—offers its 
										own unique challenges, expectations, and rewards. But what ties them all together is a shared mission: 
										helping people find clarity, meaning, and access in an information-rich world.
									</p><p style="line-height: 1.5; margin-bottom: 0.5em;"> 
										Reflecting on these spaces has been more of a personal experience than an academic one. The school 
										library was my sanctuary, especially during recess, where I was able to experience a sense of calm and 
										safety. The public library also holds warm memories of my family—visits after school with my siblings, 
										joining whatever events or reading programs were happening, and always leaving with more books than we 
										could carry. Academic libraries have become a pillar of my university life, providing access to scholarly 
										articles, textbooks, and quiet spaces that have supported me through countless assignments and late-night study sessions.
									</p><p style="line-height: 1.5; margin-bottom: 1em;">
										Seeing these environments side by side helped me understand how information professionals, while 
										working in very different contexts, are all part of a larger ecosystem. They’re not siloed—they 
										share strategies, values, and a common purpose. Whether it’s supporting community needs, shaping 
										the next generation of thinkers, or advancing research and innovation, each role matters. 
										Knowing this helps me move forward with a stronger sense of purpose—and deep appreciation—for 
										the many ways libraries have already impacted my life, and the many ways I hope to give back 
										through my own work in this field.
