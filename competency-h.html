											<h2>Competency H</h2>
											<p style="font-family: 'Open Sans', Arial, sans-serif; font-weight: 300;">Demonstrate proficiency in identifying, using, and evaluating current and emerging information and communication technologies. </p>
											
										</header>

										<section>
											<h3 style="margin-bottom: 0.5em;">Introduction</h3>
											<p style="line-height: 1.5; margin-bottom: .6em;">
												Technological proficiency has become an important competency for information professionals, 
												as rapid technological advancements continue to reshape how information is accessed, consumed, 
												and created. With the proliferation of information and communication technologies (ICT), 
												libraries and other information organizations have redefined their role in the community. 
												Information professionals no longer simply curate physical collections or serve as gatekeepers 
												of knowledge; they have become facilitators of technological access, integrating new tools 
												and creating spaces like makerspaces to build creativity, collaboration, and hands-on learning 
												(Hirsh, 2015; Breeding, 2021).

												The skillset of information professionals has expanded beyond traditional librarian duties to 
												include specialized technological skills in areas like network management, database administration, 
												website development, and technical support for digital tools (Hirsh, 2015). Keeping up with 
												emerging technologies is essential for enhancing service delivery, keeping libraries relevant 
												in a digital-first world, and helping users navigate the rapidly evolving technological landscape.
												<p style="line-height: 1.5; margin-bottom: 1em;">

												In my work at the library, I have been able to directly engage with a range of digital tools 
												and platforms, which has helped me build the technical proficiency needed to excel in today's 
												information environment. For example, public libraries have long relied on integrated library 
												systems (ILS) to manage collections, track circulation, and facilitate user access to resources. 
												The Sierra ILS, used by many libraries, streamlines these processes, and I have familiarity in 
												efficiently managing and troubleshooting cataloging and circulation tasks.
												
												By incorporating these practices into my own professional development, I am building a comprehensive 
												understanding of how to identify, use, and evaluate technologies in ways that serve both the 
												institution and the broader community. This skillset not only enhances my own technical 
												capabilities but also prepares me to contribute to the evolving role of information professionals 
												in today's digital landscape.
											<h5 style="margin-bottom: 0.3em;">Identifying</h5>
											<p style="line-height: 1.5; margin-bottom: 1em;">
												Identifying new technologies requires a proactive and informed approach to spotting emerging trends 
												that could enhance the services and operational efficiencies of information organizations. Libraries 
												are increasingly adopting technologies such as mobile apps, augmented reality, virtual reality, and 
												digital preservation tools to connect with users and improve service delivery (Breeding, 2021).
												
												Even with that, however, technological obsolescence remains a major challenge, as rapidly evolving 
												tools can become outdated or unsupported, requiring continuous evaluation and adaptation. The 
												identification process often begins with trend spotting and awareness of technological developments 
												in sectors like business and education, which have a direct impact on libraries (Breeding, 2015).
												
												To make sure that these technologies meet the needs of their communities, many information 
												organizations test new tools in controlled environments, such as pilot programs or innovation labs, 
												allowing both the library staff and the users to explore and assess their value before full 
												adoption (Breeding, 2021). This careful approach enables organizations to remain agile and adopt 
												tools that align with their mission and the needs of their community while also planning for 
												long-term sustainability to mitigate obsolescence.
											</p>
											<h5 style="margin-bottom: 0.3em;">Using</h5>
											<p style="line-height: 1.5; margin-bottom: 1em;">
												Using technology effectively is a core component of technological proficiency. 
												Information professionals must apply these tools to improve library services, 
												support user engagement, and create innovative learning environments. 
												
												The use of emerging technologies like makerspaces, mobile apps, coding platforms, 
												and data analytics can help libraries provide new educational and collaborative 
												opportunities for their users (Hirsh, 2015). Professionals need to be well-versed 
												in using these tools, whether for creating digital content, facilitating 
												interactive learning, or improving internal workflows.
												
												As libraries increasingly integrate technologies into their services, professionals 
												must make sure that these tools align with the needs of the users and provide 
												meaningful experiences. The ability to use technology not only requires technical 
												expertise but also the ability to understand the role of these tools in enhancing 
												the library's mission and connecting users with relevant information and services.
												</p>
											<h5 style="margin-bottom: 0.3em;">Evaluating</h5>
											<p style="line-height: 1.5; margin-bottom: 1em;">
												Evaluating new technologies is a critical step in determining their suitability for adoption and integration into library services. 
												It involves assessing the potential impact of technologies on both internal operations as a staff and user engagement. 
												Information professionals must examine factors like ease of use, compatibility with existing systems, scalability, and the potential for user adoption when 
												evaluating emerging tools such as augmented reality, learning management systems, and mobile apps (Breeding, 2021). 
												This evaluation process also includes considering the technological skills required for effective use and the training necessary for both staff and users. 
												An effective evaluation not only assesses the technical feasibility of the technology but also makes sure that it supports the strategic 
												goals of the library and enhances the user experience. Information professionals are always critically evaluating each tool's ability to meet the evolving 
												needs of the community while contributing to the library’s broader objectives.

												My first piece of evidence is a slide presentation and an accompanying infographic from a group project for Information Technology Tools and Applications: Information Visualization (INFO 246). This coursework prepared me to identify, use, and evaluate emerging information technologies by introducing data visualization tools, particularly Tableau.
												Tasked with gathering and analyzing COVID-19 data, my role in the group focused on creating meaningful visualizations to depict cases and deaths categorized by race and ethnicity in California. Using Tableau for the first time, I developed bar graphs and pie charts with color coding and data labels to enhance clarity and interpretation.
												These visualizations, showcased both in the slide presentation and the standalone infographic, provided insights into healthcare disparities, highlighting that Latino and White populations had the highest cases and deaths, while Asian, Multi-Race, and Native American groups exhibited distinct vulnerabilities.
												Through this project, I demonstrated the ability to identify and evaluate emerging technologies by selecting and using the dynamic visualization tool, Tableau, to present complex data in accessible visual formats. The slide presentation contextualized key findings, while the infographic distilled essential insights for broader dissemination. 
												In these deliverables, I am leveraging advanced technologies to support data-driven decision-making and effective information communication.
