												Creating this e-Portfolio has been a meaningful culmination of my MLIS journey—both challenging and rewarding in equal measure. 
												It offered me the opportunity to apply what I’ve learned, reflect deeply on my growth, and bridge the gap between theory and practice. 
												While it may not be perfect, it captures the progress I’ve made in the current moment and my ongoing commitment to growing as 
												both an information professional and a lifelong learner.</p>

										<h3 style="margin-bottom: 0.3em;">Conclusion</h3>
											<p style="line-height: 1.5; margin-bottom: 0.5em;">
											When I first spoke with a librarian about pursuing the MLIS program, I shared my concerns about not having an “ideal” 
											academic background. She simply said, “<i>There’s never not a right background for working at a library.</i>” After several 
											years of working in public libraries, I’ve come to deeply appreciate that sentiment. The versatile and inclusive nature of 
											this field means that all paths, experiences, and identities have the potential to enrich the work we do in libraries. I’ve 
											learned that it’s precisely the diversity of backgrounds we bring that makes our contributions more thoughtful, compassionate, 
											and impactful.</p>
											<p style="line-height: 1.5; margin-bottom: 0.5em;">
											Two years have gone by quickly, yet I still feel like a perpetual learner in this field—which I’ve learned is a good thing. 
											I often wonder if I’m on the right path, if becoming a librarian and information professional was the right decision. 
											But with each day that goes by, I continue to find more joy, curiosity, and meaning in this work. That, to me, feels 
											like enough validation to continue building a career in this field. It is a feeling that I am fortunate to have.</p>
											<p style="line-height: 1.5; margin-bottom: 1em;">
											Throughout this program, I’ve developed into a more thoughtful, better-equipped professional. Reflecting now, I gained 
											the ability to see information and community needs through multiple lenses, which has given me greater confidence and 
											adaptability in the work I do. Completing this e-Portfolio gave me space to synthesize my experiences and recognize 
											how much I’ve grown—through both the challenges and the small victories that have shaped my MLIS journey.</p>		

										<h4 style="margin-bottom: 0.3em;">Looking Back</h4>
											<p style="line-height: 1.5; margin-bottom: 0.5em;">
											One of the most impactful experiences in my journey was participating in the San Francisco Public Library’s Jail and 
											Reentry Services (JARS) program. Through the "Reference by Mail" initiative, I responded to information requests 
											from incarcerated individuals across California. This was my first opportunity to apply my LIS skills to serve an 
											underserved population, and it reinforced my belief in the right to library services for all. It highlighted the 
											importance of equitable access to information, particularly for those often excluded from traditional support systems.</p>
											<p style="line-height: 1.5; margin-bottom: 0.5em;">
											Visiting Ardenwood Historic Farm in Fremont, CA further expanded my understanding of community-driven archival work. 
											Conversations with park officials and volunteers allowed me to witness firsthand how local history is preserved and 
											shared, deepening my appreciation for public history and community memory. At the same time, I began learning 
											coding—an area I had always found intimidating. Gaining foundational skills in HTML, CSS, and Python revealed 
											how these tools intersect with the information profession, especially in areas like web accessibility, digital 
											literacy, and user experience design.</p>
											<p style="line-height: 1.5; margin-bottom: 0.5em;">
											Most of all, my role as a Library Page at San José Public Library has provided invaluable on-the-ground experience 
											that I consider foundational to my LIS journey. I got the opportunity to participate in initiatives such as being 
											a committee member on the Graphic Novel Making Contest team, led a youth-focused STEAM program series, helped 
											organize seasonal events, and collaborated on various displays and projects. More importantly, I built meaningful relationships with staff and patrons, grounding my academic learning in real-world contexts.</p>
											<p style="line-height: 1.5; margin-bottom: 1em;">
											Courses like Information Retrieval and Information Visualization also played an important role in shaping my 
											professional skills. Group projects in areas like card-sorting, database building, and website reorganization 
											gave me practical teamwork and design experience. Equally valuable were courses focused on social learning 
											and equity, such as INFO 181 (Teaching Life Skills in Public Libraries), INFO 282 (Well-Being and Librarianship), 
											and INFO 281 (Fostering Accessibility in the Library). These courses enabled me to integrate theory into practice, 
											designing programs that prioritize compassion, inclusion, and accessibility.</p>

										<h4 style="margin-bottom: 0.3em;">Looking Ahead</h4>
											<p style="line-height: 1.5; margin-bottom: 0.5em;">
											As I approach graduation, I can’t hide the fact that I still carry the same uncertainty I felt at the beginning—but now, 
											I face it with greater courage. While my aspiration to become a public librarian remains unchanged, the current 
											landscape has made that path feel less certain. The challenges of today's world are undeniable, yet I still choose 
											to stay hopeful. I can’t express how grateful I am for the mentors, friends, and family who have supported me 
											throughout this journey. Their encouragement, combined with the skills and insights I’ve gained, has helped me 
											hold onto a sense of optimism.</p>
											<p style="line-height: 1.5; margin-bottom: 1em;">
											As I continue my journey in the field of public libraries, I am dedicated to creating spaces that are welcoming 
											and memorable for all, much like how the library has been for me. I want to design programs and services that 
											truly reflect the voices of the community, with an emphasis on making the library a place where everyone feels 
											seen and valued. In the long term, my goal is to shape inclusive and culturally responsive services that cater 
											to diverse populations, particularly teens and young adults. Wherever I go, a few things will always guide me: 
											a sense of curiosity, a deep connection to community, and a commitment to equity in all that I do.</p>
										
										
										<h4 style="margin-bottom: 0.3em;">Affirmation</h4>
											<p style="line-height: 1.5; margin-bottom: 1em;">
											All reflective and evidentiary work in this e-Portfolio is my own, except where noted as part of group collaborations. 
											This portfolio was created solely by me.</p>
											<p style="line-height: 1.5; margin-bottom: 1em;">
											I am committed to protecting the privacy of individuals mentioned in this work, including colleagues, supervisors, patrons, and 
											community partners. Before making this e-Portfolio publicly accessible, I will remove or anonymize any identifying information to 
											uphold confidentiality and ethical standards.</p>
											<p style="line-height: 1.5; margin-bottom: 1.5em;">
											I reaffirm my commitment to the values of librarianship: equitable access, intellectual freedom, lifelong learning, and community engagement. 
											As I move forward in my career, I do so with deep appreciation for what I’ve learned, eagerness to continue growing, and excitement about the 
											many ways I can contribute to the field.</p>
