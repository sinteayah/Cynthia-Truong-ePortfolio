												<h2>Competency L</h2>
												<p style="font-family: 'Open Sans', Arial, sans-serif; font-weight: 300;">Demonstrate understanding of quantitative and qualitative research methods, the ability to design 
													a research project, and the ability to evaluate and synthesize research literature. </p>
											</header>
											

											<section>
												<h3 style="margin-bottom: 0.5em;">Introduction</h3>
												<p style="line-height: 1.5; margin-bottom: .5em;">
													I’ve always liked figuring things out. Back in my undergradate years, I got comfortable doing research—writing papers, 
													digging through sources, and organizing data to answer specific questions. It felt like a natural process: notice a problem, 
													look into it, and try to make sense of what’s going on. That same curiosity has carried into my work at a public library, 
													and even more so during my time as an MLIS student. I find myself constantly stepping into that research mindset to see 
													how to better serve the community. Why isn’t a program reaching the right audience? What kinds of services are people 
													actually using? Research methods help me approach these everyday questions in a more structured, informed way—whether 
													I’m reviewing existing literature or collecting new data to better understand a situation.</p>
												<p style="line-height: 1.5; margin-bottom: 1em;">
													In public libraries, we’re always adjusting services based on community needs. Being able to design small 
													research projects or evaluate existing studies makes those adjustments more thoughtful. This competency is 
													about applying research—not just understanding methods in theory, but using them to improve the way we serve people.</p>
												
												
		
												<h5 style="margin-bottom: 0.3em;">Quantitative and Qualitative Research Methods</h5>
												
												<div style="float: left; margin: 1em; max-width: 290px;">
													<img src="books-bookstore.jpg" alt="Books at a bookstore" 
													style="width: 100%; box-shadow: 2px 2px 4px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.5); border-radius: 10px;">
												</div>
										
												<p style="line-height: 1.5; margin-bottom: 0.5em;">
													Quantitative and qualitative research each bring something different to the table, and both are 
													essential tools for library and information science professionals. Quantitative methods allow us 
													to look at broad patterns—such as program attendance, circulation stats, user demographics, or 
													survey data—and turn those into measurable insights that can inform decisions about how services 
													are delivered (Connaway, Radford, & Powell, 2016). In public libraries, this kind of data is 
													especially helpful when reporting outcomes to funders or city agencies, identifying usage trends, 
													or comparing services across branches. Because quantitative methods rely on numerical data, 
													they also allow for statistical analysis that can highlight correlations, gaps, and patterns 
													that might not be immediately visible (Connaway, Radford, & Powell, 2016).</p>
												<p style="line-height: 1.5; margin-bottom: 0.5em;">
													Qualitative research, meanwhile, helps dig into the “why.” While numbers can tell us what is 
													happening, qualitative data can provide a deeper understanding of user behaviors, motivations, 
													and experiences. Through methods such as interviews, direct observation, focus groups, and 
													open-ended surveys, we gain insight into how people interact with library spaces, programs, 
													and resources (Lincoln, 2002). This kind of research is particularly valuable where services 
													are often shaped by community needs, and success is just as much about relationships and 
													relevance as it is about numbers. Pickard (2013) emphasizes that qualitative methods are 
													especially effective in exploring the social and cultural context of information use, which 
													aligns closely with the mission of community-focused libraries.</p>
												<p style="line-height: 1.5; margin-bottom: 1em;">
													The reason why we use both approaches is that quantitative and qualitative gives us a more 
													complete picture together. While quantitative data might show a drop in program attendance, 
													qualitative feedback might reveal that the timing no longer works for families, or that a 
													new instructor isn't connecting with the group. A mixed-methods approach, as Creswell (2009) 
													describes, helps balance the objectivity of numerical data with the insight of lived 
													experiences. In practice, this means that library professionals can make more informed 
													decisions, grounded in both hard evidence and human understanding. For me, learning 
													how to use both approaches has been essential not only in coursework but also in thinking 
													critically about how to improve services in a real-world setting.</p>

												<h5 style="margin-bottom: 0.3em;">Designing a Research Project</h5>
												<p style="line-height: 1.5; margin-bottom: .5em;">
													Following the public library setting, research questions can often emerge from practice—whether 
													through staff observations, community feedback, or service patterns. Designing a research 
													project begins by clearly articulating the problem or question, followed by a thorough 
													review of the existing literature to understand what has already been explored. Luo, 
													Brancolini, and Kennedy (2017) emphasize the value of connecting research to professional 
													practice and identifying areas where original investigation is necessary. </p>
												<p style="line-height: 1.5; margin-bottom: .5em;">
													According to Creswell (2009), strong research design includes the development of a focused 
													research question, a rationale for the selected methodology, and a clear plan for data 
													collection and analysis. The research question acts as a guidepost, informing methodological 
													choices and narrowing the scope of the study. Whether the approach is quantitative, 
													qualitative, or mixed, methods should include both the nature of the question and the 
													library context in which the research is being conducted (Connaway, Radford, & Powell, 2016). 
													This practical alignment makes it so that the project remains feasible and that the 
													findings are applicable and actionable.</p>
												<p style="line-height: 1.5; margin-bottom: 1em;">
													Additionally, engaging with the literature at the design stage can uncover methodological 
													frameworks and identify any theoretical gaps that may occur. Luo et al. (2017) note that 
													using existing studies as a foundation helps avoid duplication while revealing opportunities 
													for contribution. By combining professional observations with a literature review, 
													LIS researchers can construct well-informed, manageable studies that are rooted in 
													both evidence and real-world relevance.</p>

												<h5 style="margin-bottom: 0.3em;">Evaluation and Synthesis of Research literature</h5>
												<p style="line-height: 1.5; margin-bottom: .5em;">
													Engaging with scholarly literature is a core part of the research process, especially when 
													framing a new study or exploring an unfamiliar topic. Evaluation involves more than 
													summarizing—it requires a critical lens focused on methodology, credibility, and relevance. 
													Researchers must consider how a study was conducted, the population involved, and 
													whether its findings are transferable to other contexts (Pickard, 2013). This step is 
													essential in determining the strength and reliability of existing evidence and identifying what gaps remain.</p>
												<p style="line-height: 1.5; margin-bottom: .5em;">
													Synthesis builds on that foundation by connecting insights across multiple studies. Rather than viewing 
													sources in isolation, synthesis involves identifying common themes, methodological patterns, 
													and contradictions. This process helps researchers recognize both well-established knowledge 
													and areas that remain underexplored (Welch, Lahr, & Webb, 2021). Using structured organizational 
													strategies—such as thematic mapping or crosswalks—can help manage and interpret large volumes 
													of literature (Matteson & Warren, 2020). These techniques make it easier to detect trends, 
													classify research by setting or audience, and develop a clearer picture of the field’s current state.</p>
												<p style="line-height: 1.5; margin-bottom: 1em;">
													Critically evaluating and synthesizing literature not only improves understanding of a topic 
													but also contributes to more thoughtful study design. Recognizing previous research limitations 
													helps avoid repeating mistakes and supports the development of sharper research questions 
													(Connaway, Radford, & Powell, 2016). In the public library context, this process is especially 
													important, as it makes sure that research remains grounded in real-world needs while 
													contributing meaningfully to professional knowledge and practice.</p>

												<p style="line-height: 1.5; margin-bottom: 1em;">
													In my Information Visualization (INFO 246) course, I applied both quantitative and qualitative research methods to 
													analyze COVID-19 data by race and ethnicity in California, using public data from the California Department 
													of Public Health. My role involved creating visualizations with Tableau, such as bar charts and pie graphs, 
													to highlight disparities in infection and mortality rates. Before developing these visualizations, 
													I conducted a literature review to understand how similar public health data had been analyzed, which 
													informed my approach to interpreting the data and framing it within broader health equity discussions. 
													This combination of quantitative data analysis and qualitative literature synthesis deepened my understanding 
													of how to present research findings clearly and meaningfully. The project not only sharpened my skills 
													in data visualization and analysis but also demonstrated the importance of integrating existing research 
													to contextualize and inform new research, an essential competency for designing data-driven library services and programs.</p><br>

												<p style="line-height: 1.5; margin-bottom: 0.5em;"> 
													My second piece of evidence is a literature review matrix I created for the course Information Communities (INFO 200), 
													which supported my research on the manga reader community. The matrix was designed to help organize scholarly sources 
													and develop a deeper understanding of how information access is shaped by library systems and cataloging structures. 
													Using the template provided in class, I tracked key takeaways from each article, reflected on their relevance to my 
													research, and identified the broader significance of my topic.</p>
												<p style="line-height: 1.5; margin-bottom: 1.4em;"> 
													This assignment was my first structured experience with evaluating LIS-specific research in an organized, comparative format. 
													The matrix helped me move beyond simply reading articles—it guided me toward identifying trends in metadata practices, 
													surfacing limitations in traditional classification systems like MARC and LCSH, and recognizing emerging models that 
													center user perspectives. As I synthesized this research, I began to formulate a clearer research focus and saw how 
													gaps in the literature could inform practical improvements in how materials like manga are cataloged and discovered. 
													This process gave me hands-on experience in applying evaluative thinking to academic literature, preparing me to design 
													research with a solid grounding in existing work.</p>

												<p style="line-height: 1.5; margin-bottom: 0.5em;"> 
													My third piece of evidence comes from an assignment in Applied Research Methods (INFO 285). 
													In this project, we evaluated key variables related to library usage, focusing on how spaces 
													and technologies were being utilized at a fictional university library. I created a table 
													outlining four primary variables—library space utilization, visit frequency, technology use, 
													and study room reservations—detailing how each was measured. For example, space utilization 
													was assessed via a checklist survey, while visit frequency was categorized by scale, and technology 
													use through predefined options. The assignment also required me to identify the appropriate 
													level of measurement for each variable, from nominal to ratio, ensuring proper alignment with the research methods.
												</p><p style="line-height: 1.5; margin-bottom: 1em;">
													Additionally, I developed a sampling strategy based on convenience sampling, targeting users who 
													visited the library at specific times and were easily accessible for survey participation. I explained 
													potential biases in this method while aiming for broad representation. This task helped me refine my 
													understanding of research methodologies and the importance of defining variables, selecting measurement 
													techniques, and considering sampling limitations. Completing this assignment strengthened my ability to 
													structure a research project and apply research principles in a real-world context, equipping me with 
													the skills necessary for designing and conducting research that can inform library practices and decision-making.</p>

												<p style="line-height: 1.5; margin-bottom: 0.5em;"> 
													For my assignment in Programming and Services for Children (INFO 260A), I developed a <i>Twelve-Month Programming Plan</i> 
													for the fictional Maplewood Branch Library. The project required me to use both quantitative and qualitative research 
													methods to design a set of programs that would meet the community's needs. In the plan, I reviewed demographic data 
													and existing library usage statistics (quantitative) and will conduct interviews with a sample of parents and 
													educators (qualitative). This dual approach intends to allow me to understand the needs of the community from 
													both a statistical and a personal perspective.
												</p><p style="line-height: 1.5; margin-bottom: 1em;">
													In the planning process, I also evaluated relevant research on effective library programming. I synthesized 
													literature on best practices, including community engagement and partnerships, and applied this knowledge to 
													shape the programming plan. This research informed my decisions on program content, scheduling, and outreach 
													strategies, ensuring the plan was both evidence-based and tailored to the community’s needs. Although 
													the <i>Twelve-Month Programming Plan</i> was a theoretical exercise, the assignment helped me demonstrate my 
													ability to integrate quantitative and qualitative research methods into program design. It also showcased 
													my skills in evaluating and synthesizing existing research literature to inform decision-making in a library setting.</p>

												<h3>Conclusion</h3>
												<p style="line-height: 1.5; margin-bottom: 0.5em;"> 
													Research in public librarianship often starts with a simple question: “What’s going on here?” 
													I would like to think that my background in undergraduate research gave me the tools to 
													approach those questions systematically, and my work in libraries gave me the space to 
													apply them in meaningful ways. Whether I’m reviewing literature to write up a research 
													project or collecting data to redesign a program, I’m always drawing on what I’ve learned 
													about asking clear questions, choosing the right methods, and turning data into insight.</p>
												<p style="line-height: 1.5; margin-bottom: 1.8em;"> 
													I don’t think that research has to be overwhelming or academic in tone—it can be small-scale, 
													grounded in daily work, and focused on real people. For me, that’s where its value lies. 
													It helps me be more thoughtful and intentional in my role as a public library worker and 
													gives me the confidence to back up decisions with more than just instinct. I believe that 
													it can be one of the most practical tools I will have in public librarianship—and one I 
													plan to keep using, no matter where I work.</p>
