												The public library has always struck me as one of the few truly democratic spaces—open doors, 
												no entry fee, no expectation except curiosity. As I continue to prepare for a career in this field, 
												I keep returning to the roles that leadership and communication play in protecting and strengthening 
												that ideal. In public libraries, leadership isn’t just about administration—it’s about vision, 
												adaptability, and showing up for a community in ways that are sometimes quiet and sometimes bold. 
												Communication, too, goes beyond delivering information. It means listening well, understanding 
												nuance, and reaching people where they are—whether that’s through a short reference interaction, 
												a storytime, or a town hall meeting about access to broadband. These skills shape the tone 
												and direction of everything else we do. I see them as the tools that allow librarians to not 
												only keep up with change, but to lead it in a way that reflects the values of the communities 
												they serve. In today’s diverse and fast-paced information landscape, these skills are especially important 
												in creating spaces that are responsive, innovative, and connected to the people they serve.</p>
												<h5 style="margin-bottom: 0.3em;">Leadership</h5>
												<p style="line-height: 1.5; margin-bottom: 0.5em;">
													Leadership in public libraries can take many shapes. It might involve managing a team, 
													advocating for underserved groups, leading a community initiative, or even just stepping 
													forward to fix something no one else has addressed. As Albright (2022) explains, 
													leadership is the ability to bring people together around a shared goal and guide meaningful change. 
													In public libraries, that might mean designing new programming, reimagining services 
													after a budget cut, or navigating the impact of new technologies on access and literacy as a librarian.</p>
												<p style="line-height: 1.5; margin-bottom: 0.5em;">
													Clarke (2022) highlights design thinking as a valuable framework for leadership in information environments. 
													This approach begins with empathy and focuses on testing and refining ideas through collaboration and iteration. 
													In a public library, design thinking can help librarians develop services based on real 
													community input, not assumptions—making the work more participatory and grounded in lived experience</p>
												<p style="line-height: 1.5; margin-bottom: 1em;">
													It also isn’t always about holding a formal title. As DeLong (2009) points out, early-career 
													professionals often lead through initiative and involvement. In public libraries, this might 
													look like organizing staff training, coordinating a grant application, or participating on a 
													city-wide committee. These actions show that leadership is not only about authority—it’s 
													about responsibility, presence, and a willingness to act when something needs attention.</p>
												<h5 style="margin-bottom: 0.3em;">Communication </h5>
												<p style="line-height: 1.5; margin-bottom: 0.5em;">
													In regards to public libraries, communication is not just a skill—it’s a daily practice 
													that shapes how library staff connect with patrons, colleagues, and their wider communities. 
													Whether answering a reference question, writing a program proposal, or collaborating 
													with local organizations, staff must communicate clearly, with empathy and intention. 
													Alman (2022) emphasizes the importance of using diverse communication strategies that 
													span face-to-face conversations, digital content, social media, and formal reports. 
													Each platform demands a slightly different tone, format, and awareness of audience. 
													In a public library setting, it’s not uncommon at all to move between helping a teen 
													find a graphic novel and explaining policy changes to a city official—all in the same afternoon.</p>
												<p style="line-height: 1.5; margin-bottom: 0.5em;">
													The ability to adapt to different communication contexts also requires cultural awareness. 
													Libraries serve people from many backgrounds, and being mindful of language, tone, and access 
													is essential to respectful service. Allard, Qayyum, and Mehra (2017) stress the importance 
													of intercultural competence when serving multilingual and multicultural populations. 
													Communication isn’t always about what is said, but how it’s received—and public librarians 
													must be attuned to that difference. Simple adjustments, such as offering visual aids, 
													avoiding unnecessary jargon, or translating materials, can make services more inclusive 
													and approachable for all.</p>
												<p style="line-height: 1.5; margin-bottom: .5em;">
													Internal communication is just as important. Team-based environments depend on mutual 
													understanding and constructive feedback. Barefoot (2022) notes how tools like “framing” 
													can help shift group perspectives and create space for more meaningful collaboration. 
													Librarians who can listen well and ask the right questions often bring out the best in 
													their teams—especially during times of transition or uncertainty.</p>
												<p style="line-height: 1.5; margin-bottom: 1em;">
													Abram (2013) uses a powerful metaphor to describe the kind of thinking librarians need: 
													he suggests that effective professionals don’t just stick with the 8-crayon basic box—they 
													reach for the 64-crayon set. In other words, communication in libraries shouldn’t be limited 
													to the same old scripts or strategies. It should be creative, nuanced, and responsive to 
													the moment. This kind of communication allows librarians to better serve diverse communities, 
													solve problems in new ways, and connect with people on a more human level.</p>

												<p style="line-height: 1.5; margin-bottom: .5em; margin-top: 1em;">
													This assignment, <i>Assignment #2: Booktalks and Book Discussion Group</i>, is part of the Programming and Services 
													for Children (INFO 260A) course, where the focus is on developing effective programs that engage and inform 
													young audiences. I selected The Girl Who Drank the Moon by Kelly Barnhill, a fantasy novel aimed at tweens 
													(grades 4-7), and crafted a compelling booktalk to capture the interest of young readers while adding in 
													key themes of magic, self-discovery, and family. Through the booktalk, I thought about how to communicate 
													the novel’s core message and emotional depth clearly and engagingly to spark curiosity and discussion.</p>
												<p style="line-height: 1.5; margin-bottom: 1em;">
													The assignment also required thoughtful planning for the book discussion group, which involved taking 
													leadership in organizing every aspect of the event, from selecting the ideal target audience (tweens aged 9-12) 
													to creating a budget of $200 to $220 for event supplies and promoting the event. I developed a possible 
													promotional strategy using both digital platforms and in-person methods so that the event would reach 
													a broad audience. I also demonstrated leadership through the development of group activities, such as 
													crafting “Magic Moon Jars,” and guiding discussions with open-ended questions. My role required not only 
													the ability to communicate complex ideas effectively but also the ability to lead participants in a way 
													that encouraged collaboration, reflection, and creative engagement.</p>

											   <p style="line-height: 1.5; margin-bottom: 0.5em;"> 
													This evidence demonstrates the application of leadership and communication skills in organizing and 
													executing a STEM-based program series at the San Jose Public Library. As part of the <i>Mad Science Monday</i> series, 
													I had the opportunity to independently design, promote, and lead four hands-on experiments 
													for children, each centered around a different scientific concept, including capillary action, 
													plant science, liquid density, magnetism, and chemical reactions. The experiments featured in 
													the series were <i>Traveling Rainbow</i> and <i>Colorful Flowers</i>, <i>Lava Lamp</i>, <i>Magnetic Slime</i>, and <i>Elephant Toothpaste</i>, 
													each chosen to captivate young minds while introducing them to fundamental scientific principles in a fun and engaging way.</p>
												<p style="line-height: 1.5; margin-bottom: 1em;">
													In addition to planning and developing the experiments, I also took on the responsibility of facilitating each 
													session, leading volunteers, instructing participants, and interacting with guardians. This required clear, 
													effective communication to explain scientific concepts to a young audience and manage the logistics of the event. 
													Through this series, I demonstrated my ability to lead a group, engage children with hands-on learning, and 
													adapt my communication style to meet the needs of diverse participants, creating a positive and educational 
													experience for everyone involved. The successful implementation of this program reflects both my leadership 
													capabilities and my ability to communicate complex ideas in an accessible manner.</p>
												
												<h4 style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1_MVGDyf-d9rQ8m1LV9VyHJw4M_UC2aaN/view?usp=sharing" target="_blank">Week Four Assignment- Outreach Librarian (INFO 267)<i class="fas fa-link"></i></a></h4>
												<p style="line-height: 1.5; margin-bottom: 0.5em;"> 
													For this assignment, I interviewed a Children’s and Teen Services Librarian at a public library to gain 
													insight into outreach practices within public libraries. The experience required me to take initiative 
													in a professional setting—crafting a thoughtful interview request, preparing relevant questions, and 
													conducting the interview via Zoom. Through this process, I demonstrated communication skills by actively 
													listening, asking follow-up questions, and translating the conversation into a clear, reflective paper. 
													I also exhibited leadership by independently managing the logistics of the interview and engaging in a 
													professional dialogue with a practitioner in the field.</p>
												<p style="line-height: 1.5; margin-bottom: 1em;">
													What made this experience particularly meaningful was how it allowed me to learn directly from a 
													librarian who leads outreach efforts on a regular basis. She shared how leadership in outreach isn’t 
													just about organizing events, but also about being responsive to community needs, building relationships, 
													and representing the library outside its walls. Her emphasis on being flexible and simply showing up 
													helped me better understand what leadership looks like in practice—especially in roles that rely on 
													collaboration and public engagement. This perspective deepened my understanding of how librarians 
													lead through service and connection, which will shape how I approach outreach in my own future work.</p>
	
												<h3>Conclusion</h3>
												<p style="line-height: 1.5; margin-bottom: 1em;"> 
													After my MLIS degree, I don’t just want to work <i>in</i> a public library—I would like to be part of what 
													makes it matter to the people. That means stepping into leadership when needed, whether by guiding a 
													team through a challenging decision or advocating for inclusive policies that reflect the real lives 
													of our patrons. It means being careful with my language —knowing that how we speak, write, and listen 
													can either build trust or create distance. As someone drawn to the social impact side of librarianship, 
													I’m especially interested in how communication can be used to bridge divides and how leadership can 
													empower the underserved, not just manage them. I’m not aiming to have all the right answers and actions, 
													but I do want to ask the right questions, invite participation, and create space for ideas that might 
													not otherwise be heard. Public libraries are evolving, and I see myself growing with them—bringing a 
													mindset that’s collaborative, grounded, and always open to learning.</p>
