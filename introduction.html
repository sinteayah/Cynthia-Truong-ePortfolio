													In a world teeming with infinite information, libraries stand as quiet sanctuaries—spaces where 
													dignity and equity thrive, and where every individual, regardless of background, is welcomed and valued. 
													We enter seeking something—whether it’s knowledge, solace, or inspiration—and often leave with 
													more than we imagined: new perspectives, deeper understanding, and a sense of connection. 
													Libraries are no longer merely repositories of books; they can be recognized as living bridges that 
													connect diverse stories, ideas, and cultures. Within their walls, there is always a search for meaning, 
													and the possibilities for discovery are limitless.

												<h3>Life & Work</h3>
												<p style="margin-bottom: 0.5em;">
													Hello! I'm Cynthia (she/her), an aspiring librarian with a passion for creating meaningful, inclusive 
													experiences for all individuals. Since earning my Bachelor of Arts from the University of Southern 
													California in 2022, I’ve been working as a Library Page for the San José Public Library, where I 
													support day-to-day operations, assist patrons with their information needs, and collaborate with an 
													amazing team to keep our library thriving and our community engaged.
												</p>
												<p style="margin-bottom: 0.5em;">
													Before joining the public library world, I had the chance to explore different paths—from working at 
													a Natural History Museum to teaching science to elementary students and designing STEM programs as a 
													camp counselor. These experiences, all rooted in education and curiosity, helped me realize that 
													what I truly love is connecting people with knowledge in meaningful, creative ways—a perfect match 
													for public librarianship.
												</p>
												<p style="margin-bottom: 1em;">
													Outside of work, I’m drawn to all things art and wonder. I’m a fan of ceramics, live music, film photography, 
													cute trinkets, and beautiful animation. I love museums, admire cats and marine life, and will never (and can not) 
													say no to a good plate of pad thai. Whether I’m out and about exploring new ideas or new places, I try to take 
													things in stride—one day at a time!

												<h3>Organization & Structure</h3>
												<p style="margin-bottom: 0.5em;">
													This e-Portfolio serves as a capstone to my MLIS journey at San Jose State University School of 
													Information from August 2023 to May 2025. It demonstrates my mastery of the program’s 14 core 
													competencies and highlights how my academic work, practical experience, and personal values align 
													with the evolving field of library and information science. Each essay explores a competency’s 
													significance to the field and to my own professional development, then presents evidence of my work 
													through coursework, programs, writing, and real-world experiences. I conclude each section with a 
													reflection on how I plan to continue applying the competency in future contexts, always with a focus 
													on equity, creativity, and curiosity.
												</p>
												<p style="margin-bottom: 0.5em;">
													Without organization, this process wouldn’t have been so streamlined. Since the start of the program, 
													I’ve used Google Drive to archive my coursework—organized by class, semester, and related 
													competency—which made it easy to track my growth and retrieve meaningful work for this portfolio. 
													I continued that structure by creating planning folders for each competency, outlining essays, 
													and refining multiple drafts before finalizing each one. To bring this portfolio to life, 
													I chose to build it with my beginner HTML/CSS skills and host it using GitHub Pages. 
													This platform offered me full creative control over the site’s design and structure, 
													giving me a hands-on, flexible approach. It also gave me a chance to strengthen my digital 
													skillset—which is an increasingly important asset in today’s library and information landscape.
												</p>
												<p style="margin-bottom: 0.5em;">
													The artifacts featured here span STEAM youth programs, collaborative presentations, research papers, 
													blog posts, and public service experience. Together, they reflect not just the knowledge I’ve gained, 
													but the growth I’ve experienced as an adaptable, collaborative, and community-centered professional.
												</p>
												<p style="margin-bottom: 1em;">
													Of course, this process was not without challenges, but it offered an invaluable chance to reflect, 
													synthesize, and look forward. As I move toward a career in public librarianship, I bring with me 
													the lessons, questions, and relationships that shaped my time in the program—and the excitement 
													to keep learning and contributing, one connection at a time.
