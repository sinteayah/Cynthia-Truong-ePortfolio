											<h2>Competency N</h2>
											<p style="font-family: 'Open Sans', Arial, sans-serif; font-weight: 300;">Evaluate programs and services using measurable criteria.</p>
										</header>

										<section>
											<h3 style="margin-bottom: 0.5em;">Introduction</h3>
												<p style="line-height: 1.5; margin-bottom: 1em;">
												The effectiveness of library programs can only be true through the evaluation and assessment that shapes it. 
												When designing library services and initiatives, a well-structured evaluation process allows professionals to make informed, 
												data-driven decisions that highlight a program’s impact with the community. By analyzing outcomes, libraries can 
												determine whether their initiatives align with organizational goals, successfully engage their target audiences, 
												and address the unique needs of their communities. Without ongoing evaluation, libraries risk falling into outdated 
												practices based on tradition rather than evidence, which can hinder their ability to meet evolving community needs (Matthews, 2017).
												<p style="line-height: 1.5; margin-bottom: 1em;">
												In addition to program development, evaluation is an essential part of library marketing and advocacy strategies as it 
												helps measure whether a program is achieving its intended results or if adjustments are necessary. Evaluation also serves as 
												a powerful tool for communicating the value of library services to stakeholders by demonstrating their contributions. 
												For example, circulation statistics or reference transaction data provide measurable performance indicators that help 
												libraries justify resource allocation and highlight their impact on the community (Cassell & Hiremath, 2018). 
												Moreover, evaluation is particularly critical when developing inclusive services, such as programs for patrons with disabilities. 
												By gathering and analyzing feedback, libraries can identify gaps in accessibility and make informed improvements to enhance services, 
												making sure they are equitable and effective for all users (Lazar & Briggs, 2015).				
											<h5 style="margin-bottom: 0.3em;">Measurable Criteria</h5>
												<p style="line-height: 1.5; margin-bottom: 1em;">
												When designing an evaluation strategy, it is essential to establish measurable criteria that provide an accurate assessment 
												of a program’s performance. Measurable criteria include clear benchmarks or standards that help libraries determine the 
												success or areas of improvement for their services. Rossi et al. (2004) outline a general framework for evaluation that 
												includes setting criteria of merit, defining performance standards, measuring outcomes, and synthesizing data to form a 
												comprehensive judgment. In a public library setting, these steps help determine whether programs effectively serve the 
												community and meet organizational goals.</p>
												<p style="line-height: 1.5; margin-bottom: 1em;">
												Evaluation questions should align with stakeholder interests and focus on key aspects of program performance. 
												A well-constructed question establishes a clear standard and explains why meeting that standard is important for 
												the program’s success (Wildemuth, 2016). For example, asking, "Is at least 75% of program participants part of the 
												intended audience?" directly connects program outcomes with measurable performance criteria. This approach allows 
												evaluation data to be actionable and supports future decisions related to resource allocation, program adjustments, 
												or advocacy efforts to highlight the library’s impact (Cassell & Hiremath, 2018).</p>
											<h5 style="margin-bottom: 0.3em;">Data Collection Methods</h5>
												<p style="line-height: 1.5; margin-bottom: 1em;">
												Collecting data is a key step in evaluating the effectiveness of library programs. Surveys are among the 
												most commonly used tools for gathering user feedback because they capture personal opinions and preferences 
												from a wide audience (Connaway & Powell, 2010). While they may not always provide the most in-depth analysis, 
												surveys can offer valuable quantitative insights into community interests, perceptions, and participation. When 
												a representative sample is selected, survey results can be generalized to reflect broader trends, giving libraries 
												a clearer picture of a program’s impact. However, surveys also have their limitations, such as response bias, where 
												non-respondents might have answered differently, leading to skewed results (Fink, 2013). The sampling method used 
												in surveys plays an important role in making sure the sample is representative of the larger population. Common sampling 
												techniques include random sampling, where each individual has an equal chance of being selected, and stratified sampling, 
												which divides the population into subgroups to reflect key characteristics (Connaway & Powell, 2010). The choice of 
												sampling method influences the reliability and validity of the results, therefore making it an important consideration in data collection.</p>
												<p style="line-height: 1.5; margin-bottom: 1em;">
													Other data collection methods, including interviews, focus groups, and observations, provide alternative ways to gather user 
													input. Interviews and focus groups offer deeper qualitative insights but require more time and resources, and their findings 
													may not always apply to a larger audience (Krueger & Casey, 2015). Observations allow evaluators to assess engagement in 
													real time but may not capture the full range of user experiences. The best method depends on the goals of the evaluation 
													and the type of data needed to guide decision-making (Creswell & Creswell, 2018).</p>
									
											<h2>Evidence</h2>
											<h4 style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/11Cf6L9DrQ7DwF8g89k17rCaEWzzMCNUT/view?usp=sharing" target="_blank">Assignment #2 Variables, Measures & Sampling (INFO 285)
												<i class="fas fa-link"></i></a></h4>
											<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1">
											<p style="line-height: 1.5; margin-bottom: 0.5em;"> 
												For my Applied Research Methods course (INFO 285), Assignment #3, I developed a program evaluation plan for one of the case examples provided, the University Library Building Use Study. 
												I identified four key variables to assess library services and spaces: Library Space Utilization (measuring the use of different library areas), 
												Frequency of Library Visits (tracking how often visitors come to the library each month), Technology Use in the Library (examining the usage 
												of technological resources like Wi-Fi and computers), and Study Room Reservation (counting the number of study room bookings per month). 
												These variables were operationalized through specific survey questions, such as “Which areas of the library have you used in the past week?” 
												for space utilization and “How often do you visit the library in a typical month?” for visit frequency. Data was collected using nominal, 
												ordinal, and ratio scales depending on the nature of the variable.
											</p><p style="line-height: 1.5; margin-bottom: 0.5em;">
												Additionally, I created a sampling strategy by selecting a convenience sampling method to target library visitors who had 
												used the spaces and technologies within the past month. The evaluation plan planned to survey respondents both digitally and 
												in-person in high-traffic areas of the library. This approach helped gather a manageable sample while being mindful of time and resource constraints. 
											</p><p style="line-height: 1.5; margin-bottom: 0.5em;">
												This assignment highlights my ability to evaluate programs using clear, measurable criteria. By defining specific variables 
												and selecting appropriate data collection methods, I was able to design a plan that provides actionable insights into the 
												library's usage and the effectiveness of its services. The alignment between the survey questions and the evaluation 
												variables allows for meaningful data that can inform improvements. The sampling strategy further supports the integrity 
												of the evaluation by capturing a diverse range of responses while maintaining practical feasibility. Overall, this 
												assignment demonstrates my competence in applying systematic, evidence-based methods to evaluate a program, fulfilling the objectives of Competency N.</p>

													<img src="gimlet example.png" alt="Screenshot Example of Gimlet" style="float: left; width: 600px; margin-right: 1em; margin-bottom: 0.5em; transition: transform 0.3s ease; cursor: pointer; border: 1px solid #d6ad54;" onmouseover="this.style.transform='scale(1.9)'" onmouseout="this.style.transform='scale(1)'">
												</a>												
												For my second piece of evidence, I refer to a discussion post from my Information Visualization course (INFO 246), where 
												I examined the application of information visualization technologies, such as Gimlet, in public libraries to assess and 
												enhance services. In this discussion, I explored how Gimlet tracks and categorizes reference transactions—such as patron 
												interactions and question types—and how this data is transformed into visual reports. These visualizations enable library 
												staff to identify usage trends, evaluate service performance, and make informed decisions about staffing, resource allocation, and service adjustments.
											</p><p style="line-height: 1.5; margin-bottom: 0.5em;">
												This artifact directly demonstrates Competency N by illustrating my ability to apply measurable criteria to evaluate library services. 
												I highlighted how visualized data—such as transaction types, interaction lengths, and service frequency—can be used 
												to track library service patterns and pinpoint areas for improvement. For example, using tools like Microsoft Power BI 
												to visualize data from Gimlet helps library staff identify peak service times and assess whether additional personnel 
												or resources are required. By focusing on service-specific criteria, such as staffing needs and resource distribution, 
												I emphasized how data visualization contributes to improving library operations and service effectiveness. This directly 
												aligns with the competency’s objective of evaluating professional activities and services based on measurable data.</p>
											
											<h4 style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1102DNtyh6hpzeZocdLTj0FW85nBDgPqZ/view?usp=sharing" target="_blank">Peer Review- Evaluation of Exchange Group's Database (INFO 202)<i class="fas fa-link"></i></a></h4>
											<p style="line-height: 1.5; margin-bottom: 0.5em;"> 
												The third piece of evidence is a peer review assignment from INFO 202, where I evaluated the design, functionality, and effectiveness 
												of a database developed by an Exchange Group. My role in this project was to apply measurable criteria to assess the clarity, 
												consistency, and usability of the database. I identified areas for improvement, such as clarifying ambiguous terms like “individual consumption” 
												and recommending the inclusion of vendor location information. Additionally, I suggested changes to improve the user experience, 
												such as incorporating visual aids and reorganizing the rules to better align with the submission form.
											</p><p style="line-height: 1.5; margin-bottom: 0.5em;">
												By offering feedback grounded in concrete standards—such as clarity, usability, and consistency—I illustrated how applying 
												measurable criteria can lead to meaningful improvements. My recommendations aimed to enhance both the database’s functionality 
												and its user experience, underscoring the importance of clear, actionable insights in service evaluation. This peer 
												review not only allowed me to contribute to the refinement of a professional information system but also helped reinforce 
												my ability to assess and improve services based on observable, measurable standards. In doing so, I strengthened my skills 
												in evaluating information systems and services, making sure that my feedback aligns with the competency's goal of using clear, 
												evidence-based criteria for continuous service improvement.

											<h3>Conclusion</h3>
											<p style="line-height: 1.5; margin-bottom: 0.5em;"> 
												The effective evaluation of library programs and services is indispensable for keeping libraries responsive to the 
												ever-changing needs of their communities and staff. By applying measurable criteria, libraries can assess whether 
												a program achieves its goals, supports the institution’s mission, and produces meaningful outcomes for users. 
												Data-driven insights from tools such as surveys, reference tracking systems, and information visualizations help 
												identify areas that need improvement, optimize resource allocation, and elevate the quality of services offered.</p>
											<p style="line-height: 1.5; margin-bottom: 0.5em;"> 
												Moreover, evaluation is not just about reviewing current programs—it's essential for shaping future initiatives and 
												demonstrating the library’s ongoing impact. As Lazar and Briggs (2015) note, regular evaluations of accessibility 
												services allow libraries to enhance inclusivity, making sure patrons with print disabilities have equitable access 
												to services. Tools like Gimlet, which track reference transactions, provide important data that helps libraries 
												assess service usage and guide improvements (Chan & Johns-Masten, 2014). By using robust evaluation processes, 
												libraries can make data-backed decisions, refine their offerings, and make sure they meet community needs more effectively.</p>
											<p style="line-height: 1.5; margin-bottom: 0.5em;"> 
												For public libraries, evaluation is particularly valuable in aligning services with community expectations and building 
												engagement. With limited resources, libraries must make strategic decisions on how to best serve diverse populations 
												and the demographic of the community. Whether focusing on outreach programs for underserved communities or innovating 
												digital literacy services, evaluation assists libraries to make informed decisions, advocate for their value, and 
												continuously adapt to meet the evolving information needs of the public. Through thoughtful and consistent evaluation 
												practices, public libraries can uphold their critical role as community hubs—offering valuable programs, demonstrating 
												their worth to stakeholders, and supporting lifelong learning and inclusivity. In sum, evaluation is not just a tool 
												for assessing past performance but a cornerstone for continuous growth and excellence in public library services.</p>
