												<h3 style="margin-bottom: 0.5em;">Introduction</h3>
												<p style="line-height: 1.5; margin-bottom: 1em;">
													In today's world, libraries transcend their role as mere repositories of information; they are dynamic and transformative spaces where individuals 
													from diverse backgrounds convene to learn, explore, connect, and more. As an aspiring information professional entrusted with designing community-centered programs, I recognize the importance of authentically reflecting the demographic and cultural mosaic of society. 
													I believe that true diversity goes beyond a surface-level acknowledgment of differences; it requires a deliberate and thoughtful approach to embracing equity and inclusion, particularly for
													 historically marginalized communities. To fulfill this mission effectively, libraries must prioritize diversity, inclusivity, and equity not only in their collections, programs, 
													 and services but also within their organizational culture and workforce. These principles are fundamental to representing the full spectrum of human experiences and building environments where every individual feels recognized, respected, and empowered (Wong & Figueroa, 2015).
												<h5 style="margin-bottom: 0.3em;">Diversity</h5>
												<p style="line-height: 1.5; margin-bottom: 1em;">Diversity in libraries involves recognizing and reflecting the broad range of identities, backgrounds, and experiences within a community, including—but not limited to—factors such as race, ethnicity, language, age, gender identity, ability, 
													and socioeconomic status. A diverse library collection and program roster allows patrons to see themselves represented while also gaining exposure to perspectives that differ from their own. 
													The American Library Association (ALA) underscores diversity as a core value of librarianship, advocating for collections and services that celebrate and respect cultural differences 
													(American Library Association, 2012). By embracing diversity, libraries can promote empathy, broaden worldviews, and better meet the informational and educational needs of their communities. 
													Diversity within the library workforce is also essential. As Allard, Mehra, and Qayyum (2007) highlight, a heterogeneous staff brings a wealth of perspectives and lived experiences, enabling meaningful 
													connections with multicultural patrons. These varied perspectives can also spark innovative solutions in service delivery and programming. To fully harness the benefits of a diverse workforce, 
													focusing on intercultural leadership is important. Leaders must actively advocate for culturally sensitive practices and provide professional development opportunities that promote equity and inclusivity, 
													empowering library staff to better meet the needs of their diverse communities and create stronger engagement.</p>
												<h5 style="margin-bottom: 0.3em;">Equity</h5>
												<p style="line-height: 1.5; margin-bottom: 1em;">Equity in libraries goes beyond simply providing equal resources—it involves recognizing and addressing the unique 
													challenges different groups face and making sure they have the support needed to thrive. In this field, I have learned that books are not just mirrors 
													reflecting our own experiences but windows that offer insight into the lives of others, helping people gain understanding and compassion (Bishop, 1990). 
													Advocating for equity in access to information also means defending intellectual freedom and privacy, allowing patrons to explore ideas without fear of judgment or surveillance. 
													This includes supporting the right to access materials, even those with differing or controversial viewpoints, as they provide valuable perspectives on how others think and experience the world. 
													In practice, equity may involve targeted outreach to historically marginalized communities or providing adaptive technologies for patrons with disabilities. 
													The Public Library Association (PLA) emphasizes that equitable services must be intentional and responsive, dismantling barriers to information and opportunities 
													(Public Library Association, n.d.). By prioritizing equity, libraries uphold their mission as democratic spaces where learning, creativity, and exploration are accessible to all.
												</p>
												<h5 style="margin-bottom: 0.3em;">Inclusion</h5>
												<p style="line-height: 1.5; margin-bottom: 1em;">Inclusive libraries go beyond representation to guarantee that all patrons can fully engage with and benefit from their offerings. These spaces are designed to be welcoming 
													and respectful environments where people of all backgrounds and abilities feel empowered. To achieve this, libraries must thoughtfully design programs 
													that accommodate diverse learning styles, cultural contexts, and abilities. According to the International Federation of Library Associations and Institutions, 
													the Guidelines for Library Services to Multicultural Communities (2009) it mentions that inclusion strengthens community bonds and builds trust, turning libraries into 
													dynamic hubs of connection and discovery. Active listening and collaboration with community members are essential to aligning library services with their needs and voices.
													Leadership plays an important role in creating that inclusive library space by championing a culture of empathy and open communication. 
													Embracing cultural humility is a crucial practice for information professionals. It involves ongoing learning, self-reflection, 
													and adapting to meet the evolving needs of communities (Hurley, Kostelecky, & Townsend, 2021). Effective leaders cultivate environments where diversity is valued by 
													demonstrating emotional intelligence, including self-awareness, empathic listening, and transparent communication (Sawyer, 2015). Recognizing the unique strengths 
													of staff members and investing in their professional development helps library leaders guide institutions that adapt thoughtfully to shifting cultural and informational landscapes.

												<p style="line-height: 1.5; margin-bottom: 0.5em;">
													My first piece of evidence demonstrating competency in promoting equity, diversity, and inclusion in library services is my work on book displays and blogs for San José Public Library (SJPL) as a Library Page. 
													These initiatives allowed me to curate materials that represented diverse voices, creating opportunities for patrons to engage with meaningful stories and perspectives.
													The book displays I curated showcased key themes, including AAPI Heritage Month, Lunar New Year, Japanese Pop Culture, Banned Books Week, and Black History Month. The AAPI Heritage Month display highlighted literature by and about Asian American and Pacific Islander communities, 
													focusing on cultural representation and understanding. For Lunar New Year, I featured books that explored the various traditions, stories, and histories surrounding this celebration across various Asian cultures. The Japanese Pop Culture display spotlighted manga, anime art books, 
													and titles exploring the cultural influence of Japan's entertainment industry. The Banned Books Month display celebrated the freedom to read, spotlighting titles frequently challenged for their unique narratives, accompanied by notes explaining the reasons for the challenges, 
													thereby encouraging reflection on intellectual freedom and inclusivity. The Black History Month display honored African American history and resilience, highlighting works that celebrated Black voices, achievements, and cultural contributions.
													 Additionally, I contributed to SJPL's AAPI Heritage Month blogging efforts, creating a post with a curated book list and cultural insights to graphic novels by AAPI authors and/or illustrators. 
													These combined efforts, both physical and digital, reflect my ability to curate inclusive content that supports equitable access to information and focus on cultural awareness. Informed by my MLIS coursework, my work at SJPL has equipped me to 
													thoughtfully engage with my community and help contribute to the environment of my library.

												<p style="line-height: 1.5; margin-bottom: 0.5em;"> Another one of my key pieces of evidence for demonstrating competency in designing culturally responsive library programs is my project <i>Building Inclusive Teen Programs: A Culturally Responsive Approach at Evergreen Branch Library</i> 
													from my Intercultural Communication (INFO 281) course. This project provided a comprehensive understanding of creating inclusive programming that promotes cultural pride and social connection while 
													respecting the diverse identities of the Evergreen Branch community. Drawing from intercultural communication theories, including Ting-Toomey and Dorjee's (2019) mindful communication framework, I developed a thoughtful approach emphasizing collaboration, creativity, and cultural representation.
													The project proposed several teen-focused initiatives, including a Cultural Heritage Wall Contest, a Cooking Across Cultures workshop series, and a Makerspace Program centered on storytelling 
													and creative expression. These programs were designed with a focus on self-expression, skill-building, and social engagement while celebrating cultural heritage. 
													For example, the Cultural Heritage Wall Contest invites teens to share their narratives through visual arts, writing, photography, or digital media. This project tested my abilities to assess community needs, 
													design culturally relevant programming, and learn how meaningful community connections can help with inclusive and culturally sensitive program delivery.

													One key piece of evidence demonstrating my competency in promoting inclusive library services is my work on developing and promoting the Vietnamese-English 
													class series at my library branch from San José Public Library (SJPL) for children aged 7 to 11. In response to frequent patron requests, I supported a fellow librarian by creating an engaging lesson 
													plan and curating Vietnamese-English books to enhance student learning. Our focus extended beyond language acquisition, emphasizing the importance of building a meaningful cultural connection to 
													Vietnamese heritage for the young learners. Recognizing the need for improvements, I focused on making lessons interactive and visually appealing to better capture young learners' attention. 
													Additionally, I supported the bilingual Music and Movement program held twice a week by promoting it in both English and Vietnamese on the library's announcement board. 
													This bilingual outreach helped connect with Vietnamese-speaking families and, hopefully, build a more inclusive library environment. These experiences reinforced my commitment to becoming a library 
													leader who listens, learns, and adapts to community needs, demonstrating my ability to support meaningful, thoughtful learning experiences and bridge cultural and linguistic gaps.

												<p style="line-height: 1.5; margin-bottom: 0.5em;"> <iframe src="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/e/2PACX-1vQsbAaP8hVNOHu9TOHR_OSLa9kSjhGFuM_8IuJku11mZ_ijn5nUiqloK6EelrEori1JeiN3yBFp7qhA/embed?start=false&loop=true&delayms=3000" frameborder="0" width="960" height="569" allowfullscreen="true" mozallowfullscreen="true" webkitallowfullscreen="true"></iframe></p>
												<p style="line-height: 1.5; margin-bottom: 0.5em;">My coursework in Fostering Accessibility in Libraries (INFO 281) prepared me to understand and support accessible library services. For this project, I researched the Andrew Heiskell Braille and Talking Book Library, a specialized branch of the New York Public Library. 
													This library provides accessible reading materials for individuals who are blind, visually impaired, or have physical disabilities, with diverse and trained staff and volunteers leading events, 
													creating an inclusive environment. Its services include braille books, talking book players, assistive technologies, and personalized support. 
													The project highlighted the critical role libraries play in fostering accessibility and inspired me to think about improvements that could be made to better serve patrons with disabilities. 
													Suggestions included implementing personalized reading recommendations, expanding virtual programming, and incorporating continuous evaluation through patron feedback and partnerships with community organizations. 
													My research reinforced the importance of equitable access to library services and sparked my interest in contributing to accessibility initiatives in my future libraries so everyone can fully enjoy reading, learning, and engaging with their community.
												</p>
												<h3>Conclusion</h3>
												<p style="line-height: 1.5;"> In an era marked by social fragmentation and ideological polarization, libraries must remain steadfast as bastions of intellectual freedom and inclusivity. 
													They are responsible for providing access to diverse viewpoints, even those that challenge dominant narratives, as this aligns with the profession's core commitment to the free exchange of ideas. 
													While libraries do not need to endorse every perspective, they must defend patrons' right to explore and engage with a broad spectrum of ideas. 
													By upholding these values, libraries strengthen their identity as inclusive, intellectually vibrant spaces for lifelong learning, critical inquiry, and civic engagement.
													To fulfill this role, libraries must address service gaps and create environments where all patrons feel valued and represented. Developing cultural competence among library professionals makes sure that services meet the needs of the communities (Cooke, 2016). 
													Thoughtful program design and meaningful engagement promote inclusivity and provide opportunities for personal growth (Allard, Mehra, & Qayyum, 2007). 
													It is through these efforts that libraries can become powerful catalysts for curiosity and learning.</p>
