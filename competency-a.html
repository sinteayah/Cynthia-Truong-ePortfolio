										<section>
											<h3 style="margin-bottom: 0.5em;">Introduction</h3>
												<p style="line-height: 1.5; margin-bottom: .5em;">
												As a library worker and aspiring librarian, I have come to deeply appreciate the essential role libraries play in society by 
												providing access to information and encouraging the exchange of ideas. The future of libraries lies in their ability to serve 
												as both mirrors and windows into the diverse experiences of the world. As R.S. Bishop (1990) noted, books are not only mirrors 
												that reflect our own experiences but also windows into the lives of others, offering us a chance to empathize with people 
												who may lead different lives. This concept is particularly meaningful to me, as I have personally experienced how reading 
												about different cultures and viewpoints can broaden my understanding of the world. Iâ€™ve come to appreciate how libraries 
												create spaces for such exchange, where individuals can not only learn about others but also see reflections of themselves 
												in the materials they access. This ability to connect with diverse perspectives is a cornerstone of intellectual freedom, 
												which allows individuals to explore various ideas and cultures freely (Hirsh, 2022).
												<p style="line-height: 1.5; margin-bottom: 1em;">
												The importance of upholding ethical principles such as intellectual freedom, access, and privacy remains ever more relevant 
												as libraries continue to evolve. Libraries are responsible for offering resources that respect the diverse needs of their patrons. 
												This includes providing equitable access to information, regardless of background or identity. Additionally, libraries 
												uphold privacy rights, allowing individuals to explore ideas and information without fear of judgment or surveillance 
												(American Library Association [ALA], 2021). In my work, I am committed to supporting these principles in tangible ways, 
												promoting access to diverse ideas and protecting individuals' rights to explore information freely, without constraints 
												or bias. I look forward to applying these ethical values in my current and future roles to help create inclusive and open 
												environments for all patrons and communities.	
											<h5 style="margin-bottom: 0.3em;">Intellectual Freedom</h5>
												<p style="line-height: 1.5; margin-bottom: .5em;">
												Intellectual freedom is a core principle in library science as outlined in key documents such as the ALA Code 
												of Ethics and the Library Bill of Rights (American Library Association [ALA], 2021, 2019). It affirms the right 
												of individuals to freely access information, regardless of its content or viewpoint. Librarians are entrusted 
												with defending this freedom, even in the face of political and social pressures to censor materials. However, 
												advocating for intellectual freedom is not always straightforward. It requires librarians to support individuals' 
												right to access information, even when the material may be controversial or objectionable to some community members.</p>
												<p style="line-height: 1.5; margin-bottom: .5em;">
												A key example of this ethical challenge is the ongoing debate over book banning in schools and libraries. 
												Proponents of censorship often argue that it is necessary to "protect children," but such actions raise concerns 
												about limiting young readers' exposure to diverse perspectives and hindering their intellectual development 
												(Caldwell-Stone, 2022). In these cases, librarians must carefully balance the responsibility of protecting intellectual 
												freedom with addressing the community's concerns, navigating the tension between personal values and social responsibility.</p>
												<p style="line-height: 1.5; margin-bottom: 1em;">
												As a public library worker, I see this balancing act play out daily. Public libraries serve a broad and diverse 
												community, each with unique needs and viewpoints, and it is our responsibility to provide equal access to resources. 
												This can be especially challenging when confronted with censorship efforts or requests to remove materials deemed 
												inappropriate by some. While it can be difficult to advocate for controversial materials, I remind myself that 
												our role as library workers is to support intellectual growth by offering a wide range of information, even when 
												it challenges prevailing beliefs. By adhering to these values, we help maintain the integrity of public libraries 
												as inclusive spaces for everyone, regardless of their background or perspective.</p>

										style="width: 100%; max-width: 350px; float: left; margin-right: 1em; box-shadow: 2px 2px 4px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.5); border-radius: 10px;">

											<h5 style="margin-bottom: 0.3em;">Access & Equity</h5>
												<p style="line-height: 1.5; margin-bottom: .5em;">
												Access and equity are foundational principles that guide library practice, yet achieving true equity requires more 
												than just offering a variety of materials in a collection. It involves actively addressing the barriers that 
												prevent certain groups from fully benefiting from library services. As Bright (2022) points out, libraries must 
												work to create inclusive environments that meet the diverse needs of all patrons, particularly those from marginalized 
												or underrepresented communities. This can include providing the materials in different formats, such as large 
												print books or audiobooks, and making sure that library programs are accessible to individuals with disabilities. 
												Equity in access also requires confronting institutional barriers that limit access for certain communities, 
												whether those barriers are financial, technological, or social.</p>
												<p style="line-height: 1.5; margin-bottom: 1em;">
												The ethical responsibility to promote access and equity extends beyond merely providing physical resources. 
												Libraries must consider how they structure their services and whether they are truly inclusive. For instance, 
												libraries should evaluate whether their outreach programs effectively reach underserved communities and if their 
												online services are accessible to people with limited technological resources (Bright, 2022). The ethical 
												challenge lies in making sure that all individuals, regardless of their background or circumstances, have 
												meaningful opportunities to engage with the libraryâ€™s offerings and services. Achieving true equity of access 
												requires continuous reflection, adaptation, and the active removal of obstacles that could prevent some groups 
												from fully participating.</p>
											<h5 style="margin-bottom: 0.3em;">Privacy</h5>
												<p style="line-height: 1.5; margin-bottom: .3em;">
												Privacy is another critical ethical principle in library practice. The right to privacy protects individualsâ€™ ability to 
												access information without fear of surveillance or judgment. As libraries increasingly provide digital services, the need 
												to safeguard patron privacy has become even more prevalent. Library users should feel free to browse, borrow, and read 
												materials without concerns about their activities being tracked or monitored. This aspect of library service is rooted in 
												the ethical principles of autonomy and confidentiality, making sure that patrons can explore ideas and access information 
												independently, without external interference (American Library Association [ALA], 2021).</p>
												<p style="line-height: 1.5; margin-bottom: 1em;">
												In practice, maintaining privacy in library services can be complex, particularly as libraries balance the use of 
												technology with privacy concerns. Libraries must implement strong data protection measures to safeguard usersâ€™ 
												personal information while making sure that their resources remain accessible. Additionally, librarians must 
												stay informed about legal and technological developments that may impact privacy rights, as well as the libraryâ€™s 
												privacy policies. The challenge lies in navigating the tension between facilitating access to digital information 
												and protecting the privacy rights of individuals who use library services (Givens, 2022).</p>
									
											<h2>Evidence</h2>
											<h4 style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/125DmS5c-8s3gIpLPfZ2l5d7a8e5Y6wnQ/view?usp=sharing" target="_blank">Discussion #8: Becoming Ethical Intercultural Practitioners & Improving Communication Practices (INFO 281)<i class="fas fa-link"></i></a></h4>
											<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1">
											<p style="line-height: 1.5; margin-bottom: 0.5em;"> 
												For my first piece of evidence, I selected <i>Discussion #8: Becoming Ethical Intercultural Practitioners & Improving 
												Communication Practices</i> from my Well Being and Librarianship (INFO 281) course. In this discussion, I explored the 
												ethical considerations of communicating with individuals from different cultures and how cultural competence and 
												humility shape professional interactions. I emphasized the importance of adapting communication to the audience's 
												cultural context, prioritizing their needs over my own first, and reflecting on certain topics, like the concept of 
												"becoming a chameleon" in communication to better connect with diverse groups.
											</p><p style="line-height: 1.5; margin-bottom: 0.5em;">
												This assignment highlights my understanding of the ethical principles central to library practice, especially 
												in intercultural and diverse contexts. I reflected on how key values like flexibility, humility, and respect are 
												essential for navigating communication in a way that honors cultural differences while maintaining fairness 
												and inclusivity. Furthermore, by discussing the importance of adjusting communication based on the audienceâ€™s 
												education level, I discussed the challenges of applying ethical principles in real-world situations. I believe 
												that this directly aligns with the core values of the library profession, such as providing equitable access 
												to information and ensuring inclusivity. Overall, this artifact demonstrates my commitment to applying these 
												ethical principles in professional environments.</p>

											<h4 style="text-decoration: underline;"> <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/18zADfnB_umwywQJ1Q_-2qgP1UsVgjSQH/view?usp=sharing" target="_blank">Assignment #1: Accessibility Research (INFO 281)<i class="fas fa-link"></i></a></h4>
											<p style="line-height: 1.5; margin-bottom: 0.5em;"> 
												For my <i>Accessibility Research</i> project in the Fostering Accessibility in Libraries (INFO 281) course, I explored visual impairments, 
												including blindness and low vision, a topic that resonates with me personally. Blindness is the complete loss of vision, 
												while low vision includes conditions such as macular degeneration, glaucoma, and diabetic retinopathy, all of which 
												significantly affect daily tasks and independent navigation. My research focused on the challenges libraries face in 
												applying ethical principles, particularly around equitable access, as they work to integrate assistive technologies 
												and meet the needs of all patrons. Budget constraints, staff training, and the implementation of specialized resources 
												can make these efforts difficult. However, despite these challenges, libraries continue to offer important resources 
												such as large print books, Braille materials, audiobooks, and read-aloud picture books. This project deepened my 
												understanding of how libraries, grounded in values of inclusion and social responsibility, apply their ethical principles 
												to create accessible environments. It also reinforced the role libraries play in offering equitable access to information, 
												especially for individuals with disabilities, demonstrating how libraries actively work to break down accessibility 
												barriers and support individuals of all abilities in participating fully in society.</p>
											
											<h4 style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1G_t6lf07XVHZXZa7qpUU1wR2Iu6lvRtc/view?usp=sharing" target="_blank">Final Project: A Well Being Philosophy for Public Librarianship (INFO 282)<i class="fas fa-link"></i></a></h4>
											<p style="line-height: 1.5; margin-bottom: 0.5em;"> 
												For my third piece of evidence, I selected my Final Project from the Well Being and Librarianship (INFO 282) 
												course, where I crafted a personal wellbeing philosophy for my future career in public librarianship. This 
												project emphasizes the significant role that personal wellbeing plays in the effectiveness of public librarians, 
												shaping both their ability to serve their communities and their own professional satisfaction. Recognizing that 
												librarians often face unique stressors, such as job creep, emotional labor, and the pressures of working in a 
												fast-paced environment, I explored strategies for maintaining mental, emotional, and physical balance to prevent 
												burnout and foster long-term fulfillment. In my philosophy, I stressed the importance of self-awareness and 
												self-compassion in navigating the challenges of public librarianship. In addition to this, I explored practical 
												methods for creating a supportive work environment, including setting clear boundaries, maintaining work-life balance, 
												and making sure I take time for hobbies and social activities that nurture my wellbeing.
											</p><p style="line-height: 1.5; margin-bottom: 0.5em;">
												This project directly aligns with the importance of maintaining a healthy and positive workplace culture, 
												which is essential in providing effective library services. I reflected on how this personal philosophy 
												will not only contribute to my career satisfaction but also to the quality of service I provide to my 
												community. By implementing these strategies, I am committed to developing a fulfilling career that supports 
												my personal wellbeing while enhancing my ability to contribute meaningfully to the community I serve. 
												Ultimately, I believe that prioritizing self-care will positively affect both my personal life and my 
												professional practice, creating a ripple effect that benefits both myself and the patrons I serve.

											<p style="line-height: 1.5; margin-bottom: 0.5em;"> 
												Another piece of evidence is my participation in the Jails and Reentry Services (JARS) program with 
												the San Francisco Public Library (SFPL) during my Reference and Information Services (INFO 210) course. 
												In this project, I provided reference services to incarcerated individuals across California through 
												the "Reference by Mail" system. I responded to three requests, conducting detailed research to provide 
												accurate, relevant, and accessible information to inmates with limited access to resources. After 
												the reference questions were answered, I would reply in a letter format to each personal request. 
											</p><p style="line-height: 1.5; margin-bottom: 0.5em;">
												One of the first tasks I worked on was assisting an inmate in finding nonprofit services for veterans. 
												This required me to not only verify the information for accuracy but also consider the privacy and 
												sensitivity of the situation. I realized how important timely and correct information can be to an 
												inmate's rehabilitation and successful reintegration into society. This project allowed me to 
												directly apply core library principles such as intellectual freedom, social responsibility, and 
												equitable access, demonstrating my ability to adapt services to meet the unique needs of a 
												population with limited resources. It was a deeply personal and meaningful experience, reinforcing 
												my commitment to making sure that individuals, no matter their circumstances, have access 
												to the information they need to thrive.</p><br>

											<h3>Conclusion</h3>
											<p style="line-height: 1.5; margin-bottom: 0.5em;"> 
												In sum, the ethical principles of intellectual freedom, access, equity, and privacy are essential to the 
												library profession in various ways. These values guide library practices and shape the way libraries and 
												library professionals serve their communities. However, applying these principles in real-world contexts 
												is often complex and requires librarians to navigate competing interests, such as balancing access with 
												concerns about censorship or guaranteeing privacy in an increasingly digital world. By adhering to these 
												ethical principles, the library plays another yet important role of promoting social justice and empowering 
												individuals to access the information they need to thrive. As libraries continue to evolve, it is important 
												to build some connection with these values and have professionals remain committed to upholding them, 
												making sure that libraries continue to be spaces of inclusion, equity, and intellectual freedom.</p><br>
