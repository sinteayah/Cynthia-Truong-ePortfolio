												<h3 style="margin-bottom: 0.5em;">Introduction</h3>
												<p style="line-height: 1.5; margin-bottom: .5em;">
													As someone working at a public library and aspiring to become a librarian, I’ve come to realize 
													how important it is to understand learning theories and principles when designing effective programs. 
													The goal is not just to provide information, but to create meaningful learning experiences 
													that resonate with patrons. Through my work at the library, I've observed firsthand how 
													different learning styles and needs can influence the way people engage with information. 
													Understanding concepts like constructivism, cognitive load theory, and collaborative learning 
													has helped me think more critically about how library programs can be designed to enhance 
													learning, whether it’s through individual exploration or group-based activities.</p>
												<p style="line-height: 1.5; margin-bottom: 1em;">
													By incorporating these theories into instructional design, I believe we can create programs that 
													are accessible, engaging, and responsive to the diverse needs of library users. Whether I’m leading 
													a workshop on using library resources or assisting a patron with a research project, these 
													learning theories will guide me in providing effective, learner-centered experiences that 
													cater to different learning preferences.</p>

												<h5 style="margin-bottom: 0.3em;">Constructivism</h5>
												<p style="line-height: 1.5; margin-bottom: 0.5em;">
													Constructivism, as described by Piaget (1970) and Vygotsky (1978), emphasizes that learning 
													is an active process where learners build upon prior knowledge through experience and social 
													interaction. Piaget (1952) suggests that individuals construct their understanding by interacting 
													with the environment, while Vygotsky (1978) focuses on the social aspect of learning, 
													highlighting the importance of the "More Knowledgeable Other" (MKO) in supporting the 
													learner’s development. These ideas stress the importance of active engagement and 
													contextual learning in educational settings, making them particularly relevant in l
													ibrary instruction.</p>
												<p style="line-height: 1.5; margin-bottom: 1em;">
													In practice, constructivism shows up in library instruction through activities that 
													promote problem-solving and real-world application of skills. For example, in an 
													information literacy program, learners might use library resources to solve a 
													specific research problem. This approach encourages learners to actively engage 
													with content, helping them apply new knowledge in a practical context. By emphasizing 
													hands-on activities and real-world challenges, libraries create opportunities for 
													deeper understanding and better retention of skills.</p>	

												<h5 style="margin-bottom: 0.3em;">Cognitive Load Theory</h5>
												<p style="line-height: 1.5; margin-bottom: .5em;">
													Cognitive Load Theory, proposed by Sweller (1988), suggests that instructional design 
													should align with the learner’s cognitive capacity to maximize learning. Sweller (1988) 
													argues that the human brain has limited capacity for processing information, so 
													instructional materials should avoid overwhelming learners with too much content 
													at once. This theory emphasizes the need for well-structured learning experiences 
													that help learners focus on key concepts while minimizing unnecessary cognitive 
													load (Sweller, 1988).</p>
												<p style="line-height: 1.5; margin-bottom: 1em;">
													In a library context, cognitive load theory can be applied by designing instruction 
													that breaks down complex information into manageable segments. For example, when 
													teaching citation styles, a library instructor might divide the content into smaller 
													parts, use visual aids like infographics, and include interactive elements such as 
													quizzes. These strategies reduce extraneous cognitive load, allowing learners to 
													concentrate on the essential concepts. Additionally, scaffolding techniques can 
													gradually increase the complexity of the material as learners gain proficiency, 
													helping them avoid feeling overwhelmed by the content.</p>

												<h5 style="margin-bottom: 0.3em;">Collaborative Learning</h5>
												<p style="line-height: 1.5; margin-bottom: .5em;">
													Collaborative learning, as described by Johnson and Johnson (1999), emphasizes positive 
													interdependence, individual accountability, and promotive interaction—key elements for 
													effective group learning. Their research shows that when learners work together toward 
													shared goals, they develop deeper understanding, stronger critical thinking skills, 
													and greater motivation (Johnson & Johnson, 2005).</p>
												<p style="line-height: 1.5; margin-bottom: .5em;">
													In a public library setting, collaborative learning might take place during a digital 
													literacy workshop where participants work in small groups to evaluate websites. Instead 
													of receiving information passively, learners apply criteria, compare findings, and 
													contribute to a shared set of best practices. This structure reflects the principles 
													of cooperation and shared responsibility outlined by Johnson, Johnson, and Holubec (2008).</p>
												<p style="line-height: 1.5; margin-bottom: 1em;">
													Digital tools like Google Docs or Padlet can enhance this process by allowing real-time 
													collaboration and knowledge-sharing. By incorporating collaborative learning into library 
													programs, libraries create active learning environments that reflect both the social 
													and educational roles of public spaces.</p>

												<p style="line-height: 1.5; margin-bottom: 0.5em;">
													The <i>Mad Science Mondays STEM</i> workshop series is a hands-on program I created, led, and facilitated as a library 
													worker at the San José Public Library. Designed for children ages 6–11, the series introduced scientific concepts like 
													magnetism, density, and chemistry through interactive experiments such as making lava lamps and magnetic slime. 
													I developed this program originally as part of an instructional design plan for INFO 250, and then brought it to 
													life in a real-world public library setting. I was responsible for designing each session, coordinating materials, 
													training teen volunteers, and facilitating all workshops.</p>
												<p style="line-height: 1.5; margin-bottom: 1em;">
													This artifact demonstrates my ability to design and implement engaging, collaborative learning experiences 
													grounded in educational theory. The workshop structure reflects constructivist learning principles by encouraging 
													children to explore and build their own understanding through experimentation and guided discovery. Sessions 
													were intentionally structured to reduce cognitive overload—each one focused on a single scientific topic, with 
													clear goals and simple, manageable steps in line with cognitive load theory. This thoughtful instructional 
													approach supported both individual and group learning, promoted inquiry, and offered a welcoming environment 
													for young learners to engage with STEM topics in a public library context.</p>

												<p style="line-height: 1.5; margin-bottom: 0.5em;"> 
													As part of an assignment for my Programming and Services for Children (INFO 260A) course, I designed a conceptual 
													library program titled "<i>Coraline’s Adventure: A Journey Through Imagination!</i>"—a DIY/Maker event for children 
													and tweens that uses crafts, games, and storytelling to bring the world of <i>Coraline</i> to life. Though not 
													yet implemented, the program is grounded in key learning theories, particularly constructivism and cognitive load theory. 
													Participants would engage in hands-on, creative activities like crafting themed items and participating in a 
													treasure hunt, allowing them to construct knowledge through active exploration and personal connection to the story. 
													The event is structured into clear, manageable tasks to avoid overwhelming participants, supporting cognitive load 
													theory by helping young learners focus on one activity at a time.</p>
												<p style="line-height: 1.5; margin-bottom: 1.4em;"> 
													Social interaction is built into the design through collaborative stations where participants could 
													work together, share ideas, and support each other’s creativity—reflecting Vygotsky’s emphasis on the 
													importance of peer interaction in learning. While still a proposed plan, this program demonstrates my 
													ability to design learner-centered, theory-informed programming that supports both individual and 
													collaborative learning experiences, and highlights the role of libraries in building creativity, 
													imagination, and educational play.</p>

												<p style="line-height: 1.5; margin-bottom: 0.5em;"> 
													For an assignment in my Teaching Life Skills in a Public Library (INFO 281) course, we were told to research 
													and create a life skill related program for a public library. <i>Tire Tactics</i> is the hands-on library program 
													I designed to teach teens and young adults how to repair a flat tire and perform basic car maintenance. 
													Informed by learning principles such as constructivism and cognitive load theory, the workshop was 
													structured to support both individual and collaborative learning. The session was broken into manageable 
													segments—like identifying tools, following a step-by-step tire change demonstration, and practicing 
													the process on a demo vehicle—to reduce cognitive overload and help participants focus on one task 
													at a time. Visual aids and hands-on guidance allowed learners to build understanding through direct 
													experience, reflecting constructivist principles of active, contextual learning.
												</p><p style="line-height: 1.5; margin-bottom: 1em;">
													The program also focuses on collaborative learning by encouraging participants to work in pairs or small 
													groups during practice activities, promoting peer-to-peer support and shared problem-solving. These interactions 
													would help reinforce key concepts while developing communication and teamwork skills, aligning with 
													Johnson and Johnson’s cooperative learning model. <i>Tire Tactics</i> demonstrates my ability to design 
													meaningful, learner-centered programs rooted in instructional theory and shows how public libraries 
													can provide practical, engaging learning experiences that empower users with real-world skills.</p>
												
												<h3>Conclusion</h3>
												<p style="line-height: 1.5; margin-bottom: 1em;"> 
													As I continue my journey toward becoming a librarian, the principles of constructivism, cognitive load theory, 
													and collaborative learning continue to inform how I approach instructional design. Although I first 
													encountered these theories during my undergraduate years, where I applied them in a medical and health 
													context, seeing and applying them in a library setting has been a new and exciting challenge. 
													In healthcare, these theories were useful for patient education and training, but I’ve come to 
													realize how powerful they can be in the context of library services, where the goal is to engage 
													individuals in lifelong learning and discovery. Whether in one-on-one interactions or group settings, 
													these theories help me create experiences that meet the diverse needs of library patrons and 
													provide opportunities for meaningful learning. I believe that by focusing on these principles, 
													libraries can offer more than just access to information—they can create spaces where individuals 
													grow, connect, and thrive.</p>
