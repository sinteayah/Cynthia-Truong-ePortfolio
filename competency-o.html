												<h2>Competency O</h2>
												<p style="font-family: 'Open Sans', Arial, sans-serif; font-weight: 300;">Understand global perspectives on effective information 
													practices that are supportive of cultural, economic, educational, or social well-being.</p>
											</header>

											<section>
												<h3 style="margin-bottom: 0.5em;">Introduction</h3>
												<p style="line-height: 1.5; margin-bottom: .5em;">
													In today's interconnected world, information professionals must recognize the broader implications of their work
													in supporting the cultural, economic, educational, and social well-being of global communities. The challenges 
													they face are complex, as they must meet the diverse needs of populations while contributing to society's 
													collective progress. This requires not only technical expertise but also cultural awareness, adaptability, 
													and a commitment to global perspectives. As digital technologies reshape how information is shared and 
													consumed, information professionals must continually assess their role in promoting social impact and making 
													sure of equitable access for all. The IFLA Trend Report (2024) highlights how technology is transforming 
													information and knowledge systems, creating both opportunities and challenges. Digital technologies can 
													enhance accessibility and inclusivity, but they also risk deepening disparities, especially in rural 
													or underserved areas. For information professionals, this means balancing these issues and ensuring 
													systems support diverse populations effectively.</p>
												<p style="line-height: 1.5; margin-bottom: 1em;">
													This topic underscores not only the responsibility of information professionals to engage with both 
													local and global contexts., but understanding the global implications of their actions to better serve 
													their community. By embracing global perspectives, information professionals can advocate for practices 
													that address one of many society's dynamic needs.</p>
												<h5 style="margin-bottom: 0.3em;">Cultural</h5>
												<p style="line-height: 1.5; margin-bottom: 0.5em;">
													Cultural competence is essential for anyone working in information services, especially when we’re 
													serving such a diverse population. I’ve personally seen how important it is to address equity, diversity, 
													and inclusion when trying to ensure that the information we provide is both accessible and relevant 
													to everyone. As Bright (2022) notes, this goes beyond just providing services—it’s about creating 
													trust and ensuring that every cultural group feels heard and understood.</p>
												<p style="line-height: 1.5; margin-bottom: 1em;">
													For example, I’ve seen firsthand how libraries can be more inclusive when they understand the 
													cultural context of their patrons. Doucette (2019) shares a case where a library adapted its 
													services to better serve international graduate students by using culturally sensitive teaching 
													methods. This approach helped students from various backgrounds feel more connected and supported. 
													Similarly, Ting-Toomey and Tenzin Dorjee (2019) emphasize the value of intercultural communication, 
													something that resonates with my own experience in creating an environment where all community 
													members can access knowledge and resources.</p>													
												<h5 style="margin-bottom: 0.3em;">Economic & Educational</h5>
												<p style="line-height: 1.5; margin-bottom: .5em;">
													The role of information professionals in supporting economic and educational well-being is closely 
													tied to digital access. The growing digital divide remains a significant barrier, especially in 
													rural or underserved areas. This limits their ability to engage in the digital economy and access 
													educational resources. Fredenberger (2022) emphasizes that digital literacy is crucial for 
													individuals to participate in the economy, as lacking the skills to navigate the digital 
													world puts them at a disadvantage in securing employment and pursuing education.</p>
												<p style="line-height: 1.5; margin-bottom: .5em;">
													This is where information professionals can play a key role in bridging this gap. 
													Libraries and community organizations are important assets in providing digital literacy 
													resources, helping individuals develop the skills needed to participate in a 
													technology-driven world. Hirsh (2022) highlights our responsibility to promote educational 
													inclusion through these programs, enabling communities to improve their economic and 
													educational opportunities.</p>
												<p style="line-height: 1.5; margin-bottom: 1em;">
													Many knowledge systems continue to prioritize Western viewpoints, which not only marginalize 
													diverse cultural perspectives but also perpetuate a limited, narrow understanding of the world. 
													It's something I’ve thought about a lot in my own practice—how can we elevate diverse voices and 
													create spaces for these perspectives? Information professionals have the responsibility to 
													advocate for more inclusive knowledge systems, something that is especially important in today’s 
													globalized world (IFLA, 2024).</p>
												<h5 style="margin-bottom: 0.3em;">Social</h5>
												<p style="line-height: 1.5; margin-bottom: .5em;">
													The social impact of information services goes far beyond providing access to knowledge—they 
													create safe spaces where people can connect, engage, and support each other. Libraries are much 
													more than repositories of knowledge—they are vibrant community hubs where people can connect, 
													share resources, and engage in activities that nurture their personal and collective growth. 
													The IFLA Trend Report (2024) also emphasizes how information organizations can build social 
													cohesion by offering platforms for communities to connect and collaborate.</p>
												<p style="line-height: 1.5; margin-bottom: .5em;">
													A look at mobile libraries can offer a unique and powerful example of how we can impact social 
													well-being, especially in remote or underserved areas. Lo and Stark (2021a) highlight how these 
													services not only deliver books but also act as lifelines for connection. For example, in Japan, 
													mobile libraries have been crucial in providing emotional support to disaster victims, 
													helping people process trauma and find comfort (Lo & Stark, 2021b). Similarly, in Iceland, these libraries 
													help bridge the isolation of rural communities, delivering not just reading materials 
													but opportunities for social interaction (Lo & Stark, 2021b).</p>
												<p style="line-height: 1.5; margin-bottom: 1em;">
													Fredenberger (2022) also stresses the importance of libraries as trusted institutions that strengthen 
													community resilience. Libraries provide more than just resources—they create safe spaces where people 
													can learn, grow, and connect. For me, I see working in this field more than managing information. It’s 
													really building and creating a sense of belonging and helping communities build a foundation of support 
													and connection.</p>
												
								
												<h2>Evidence</h2>
												<h4 style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="https://ischoolblogs.sjsu.edu/info/info20013/2023/11/18/info-200-blog-post-6-global-manga-readers-community-and-gender-representation/" target="_blank">Blog #6- Issues the Manga Community Faces at an International Scale (INFO 200)<i class="fas fa-link"></i></a></h4>
												<p style="line-height: 1.5; margin-bottom: .5em; margin-top: 1em;">
													In my Information Communities (INFO 200) course, I explored global issues facing the manga community, particularly 
													focusing on gender representation. Manga, deeply rooted in Japanese culture, has expanded internationally, 
													yet its reception varies due to cultural and political differences. A significant issue is how gender roles 
													are portrayed, especially in shōnen manga, where female characters have historically been sexualized to 
													cater to the male gaze. However, contemporary mangakas, especially female creators, have begun to challenge 
													these norms by introducing more complex female characters, like Nobura Kugisaki from Jujutsu Kaisen, who 
													embodies strength without adopting masculine traits (Flis, 2022). This shift reflects broader cultural 
													changes and is informed by ongoing global discussions about gender representation in media.</p>
												<p style="line-height: 1.5; margin-bottom: 1em;">
													This research helped me understand how cultural and political contexts shape the accessibility and representation 
													of information within the manga community. For example, countries like Mainland China and Hong Kong impose strict 
													censorship on genres like Boys’ Love (BL), which influences how information is consumed and shared (Liu, 2009). 
													Meanwhile, the global manga community is actively discussing these issues, with fans creating alternative 
													narratives through fan art, fan fiction, and other creative works. This experience highlighted the importance 
													of considering global perspectives and supporting inclusive, equitable information practices, especially 
													in communities with diverse cultural values. Libraries, particularly those with collections focused on 
													global cultures or popular media, play an important role in providing access to such perspectives. By 
													making these works accessible to a wide range of readers, libraries promote a deeper understanding of 
													gender, culture, and the complexities that shape them.</p>

												
												<h4 style="text-decoration: underline;"> <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1yD_-I7ibaZKwjuaj7rsxFZZ41Gw9MTDaixBcQx-zjow/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank">Film Critique (INFO 281)<i class="fas fa-link"></i></a></h4>
												<p style="line-height: 1.5; margin-bottom: 0.5em;"> 
													In my Intercultural Communication (INFO 281) course, I completed a film critique of Shoplifters (2018), which provided 
													valuable insights into global perspectives on social structures and communication practices. The film, set in Japan, 
													explores the complexities of family, poverty, and marginalization through a makeshift family surviving by petty crime. 
													This portrayal helped me understand the cultural context of high-context communication, where much of the meaning 
													is conveyed non-verbally, a concept I learned in the course. The family’s relationships, expressed through gestures 
													and silence rather than explicit words, depicts how cultural communication styles can shape interactions and 
													information sharing. This insight reinforces the importance of considering diverse communication practices and 
													their impact on social well-being.</p>
												<p style="line-height: 1.5; margin-bottom: 1.4em;"> 
													For someone working at a public library, these global perspectives can be essential when providing 
													services to diverse communities. We often serve individuals from various cultural, economic, and social 
													backgrounds, and understanding how communication and family structures vary across cultures can help 
													library professionals offer more inclusive and respectful services. The themes of Shoplifters—including 
													the fluidity of family, socioeconomic struggles, and non-verbal communication—can help librarians recognize 
													the diverse needs of patrons and make sure that information is accessible in ways that resonate with different 
													cultural values. By considering these perspectives, I can support equitable information practices that 
													contribute to the well-being of all members of the community.</p>
	
												
												<h4 style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1iKFe-2Z5GjBmi7PPJG27fWOyzvjQhTy3/view?usp=sharing" target="_blank">Building Inclusive Teen Programs: A Culturally Responsive Approach at Evergreen Branch Library (INFO 281) <i class="fas fa-link"></i></a></h4>
												<p style="line-height: 1.5; margin-bottom: 0.5em;"> 
													In my Intercultural Communication (INFO 281) course, I developed a proposal for culturally responsive programming 
													aimed at engaging teens in the diverse Evergreen Branch Library community in San Jose. The library, primarily 
													focused on programs for younger children, needed initiatives specifically targeting teens to help them connect 
													with their cultural identities while also fostering personal growth. One of the central components of my 
													proposal was a Cultural Heritage Wall Contest, where teens could submit artwork, photography, writing, or 
													digital media that reflects their cultural heritage. This contest would provide a platform for self-expression, 
													building a sense of belonging and pride in their identities. Another initiative I proposed was a Cooking 
													Across Cultures workshop series, which would allow teens to learn about traditional dishes from various 
													cultures, promoting cultural understanding through food. The project also included a Cultural Makerspace 
													Program, where teens could explore their heritage through technology, such as digital storytelling and 
													creating culturally-inspired designs.
												</p><p style="line-height: 1.5; margin-bottom: 0.5em;">
													This project aligns with global perspectives on cultural diversity and communication practices, 
													as it recognizes the importance of embracing and celebrating cultural differences. In a public 
													library context, offering such culturally responsive programs ensures that the library remains 
													inclusive and relevant to all patrons, including those from marginalized or underrepresented 
													backgrounds. The project also emphasizes the value of understanding cultural differences in 
													communication and how these programs can foster social connection and community. By creating 
													spaces where teens feel seen and valued for their cultural identities, libraries can contribute 
													to a more equitable and supportive environment, addressing the educational and social needs of diverse communities.</p><br>
	
												<h3>Conclusion</h3>
												<p style="line-height: 1.5; margin-bottom: 0.5em;"> 
													As a public library professional, I see every day how libraries are more than just places for books—they’re 
													essential to the well-being of our communities. Through our work, we help people build digital skills, 
													create inclusive spaces, and provide resources that promote personal and collective growth. In a world 
													that's increasingly connected, libraries are in a unique position to bridge the digital divide, especially 
													for those in underserved and economically disadvantaged communities. We offer so much more than books; 
													we create places where people can learn, connect, and engage with others in meaningful ways.</p>
												<p style="line-height: 1.5; margin-bottom: 1.8em;"> 
													By truly understanding the global implications of our work, we can serve diverse populations more 
													effectively and adapt to their changing needs. As libraries continue to push for equity and access, 
													I believe they have the power to strengthen social ties and contribute to a more informed and 
													inclusive world. For me, this work is about more than managing information—it’s about empowering 
													individuals, building stronger communities, and making a lasting impact on the lives of those we serve.</p>
